Of course .
Today , following the events in Georgia and following the recognition by Russia of the enclaved Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Russia &apos;s willingness to build a common security zone with the European Union and its positions on Kosovo and the neighbourhood zone are diverging more than ever .
We have drawn up a common European Union standard in the area of minority rights , and that is absolutely essential .
On the other hand , however , the monitoring of macroeconomic imbalances and the redirection of competition are guaranteed , in particular , for the countries - the Member States of the European Union - which have adopted the euro due to the high level of secondary economic and financial effects among the euro area Member States ; the weaker discipline of the market ; the absence of currency risks and the greater challenges linked to the adaptation and its potential higher price for the euro area as a whole .
As far as my country , and more accurately the inhabitants affected , it is important for this decision to be approved by the European Parliament .

I would like to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and all those affected , and to express my support for local advisors , and at the same time I would like to take advantage of this forum to appeal to the European Community , because it must be stated clearly , these kinds of situations require a response from Europe and , first and foremost , its solidarity .

Written statements ( Rule 149 )
In order to strengthen stability among its eastern neighbours and reduce the impact on the Member States , the European Union must adopt a firm policy on Russia , which must be developed in close cooperation with the transatlantic partners and incorporates the relevant multilateral organisations , as well as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe .

After a fabricated process and closure from his family , which makes it difficult to visit , Taoufik Ben Brik was left in a state of health which is causing concern for his life .
However , this positive trend was not accompanied by the protection and maintenance of passengers &apos; rights : passengers have identified a number of problems , including cancellations , the sale of more tickets than the places at hand ( overververofok ) , loss of luggage and delays .
However , obviously , the first problem we will have to face is the food shortage , as already a billion people in the world are starving .

I believe that the issue of geographical balance , which focuses so often on , could have been much more successful .
On the other hand , we cannot ignore the trends in the area of media freedom , which cause concern .

I do not deny that nuclear power can form part of a well-balanced set of energy technologies in the EU and that its use can reduce our external dependency in this area , but I believe that the European Union cannot fail to participate in the closure of the outdated nuclear facility , while also providing appropriate funding for the economic recovery plans .

We are all committed to the protection of nature and public health , but a sense of balance must also be maintained .

The introduction of a minimum wage is a solution that must remain a Member State competence .
This European Parliament motion for a resolution refers to a free trade agreement between the European Union and India .
In addition , the Council referred once again to the importance of further facilitation of access to funding - I am thinking of loans , guarantees , financing from the maize and so on - and also to risk capital for newly created innovative businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises , where the consequences of the current financial crisis need to be taken into account .
The future of the euro area and the future of the European Union are two sides of the same coin .
Mr Verhofstadt , the candidate of the Liberals and Mr Juncker , the federalists &apos; nomination was not acceptable alternatives .

That would be a shame .
Members of the European Parliament have said &apos; no &apos; to the flexible response and &apos; no &apos; to the unacceptable pressure exerted by France on the main democratic body on the continent of Europe !
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we in the international community have undoubtedly placed a lot of our credibility in the events in Afghanistan .

You represent a country whose people have faced the invasion of the Warsaw Treaty &apos;s troops .

Europe &apos;s commitment to its citizens was therefore reaffirmed through Parliament &apos;s determination to find a resource in the 2011 budget , regardless of its significant margins , to provide real value for this fund .
It is for this reason that the parliamentary issue was supported by such a large majority in committee - a fact that I warmly welcome .
In conclusion , I would like to say that the very fact that the rapporteur from one of the small groups has succeeded in succeeding with such a complex dossier , with the active support of shadow rapporteurs from other political groups , is an important democratic signal and something that this institution must be proud of .
I believe that it is important to support European SMEs , as well as full liberalisation with regard to the movement of people , goods and services , in order to make the most of the benefits of the Single Market .

The environmental &apos; new deal &apos; or otherwise a new logic for economic organisation based on innovation in green technologies and supported by international capital markets will become the cornerstone of increasing numbers of economic rescue and stimulus programmes , including among the Member States of the European Union .
The bilateral agreements of some Member States to implement projects such as Nord Stream cause distrust , not only in environmental matters , but also in the principles of solidarity , and there must be transparency in this area .
I think this is important and it is also good .
We all understand that we need to fundamentally change the focus of current policy , and this is clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy .
However , what is important now is for the Commission and the Member States to enter into a good deal in Copenhagen .
My second comment relates to an objective view of multilateralism , an idea which has so often been presumed in this House .

Madam President , Mrs Figueiredo has presented this issue perfectly and I would like to add just one thing .

I would like to reiterate on behalf of all of us here our sincerest sympathy and solidarity with the victims and their families .

The European Union must adopt budgetary control mechanisms that are effective at an early prevention and detection stage , so that public funds are only used properly , irrespective of the effective punishment for those who breach the rules , trying illegally to appropriate these funds , which are , in the first place , insufficient .
I must therefore disagree with Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s opinion that the whole legislative package will only operate in one respect , namely the reversed qualified majority .
The challenges were huge : the transition from the legal system of the Treaty of Nice to that of the Treaty of Lisbon , and also the drawing up of the next multiannual programme to set priorities in the areas of freedom , security and justice for the next five years .

We know that .
This measure refuses to examine the product assessment accordingly before placing them on the market and does not mention the repeatedly revealed dangers associated with placing the GMOs on the market .
You rightly say that we need , above all , to protect the fire industry , and that is the crucial point I want to discuss .
The question of whether drug abusers should be brought to justice is a matter for the Member States and the European Union should not seek to divert the course of justice .

The European Union should intervene by taking legislative measures to ensure gender equality and reduce gender partition on the labour market .

( PL ) Mr President , in the context of today &apos;s debate , I would like to draw attention to the controversial proposal to amend Article 47 of the 2006 Commission Regulation .

Today , Parliament voted to block the authorisation of thrombin for use as an additive in food .

Under the legal procedure , the Council will adopt the text after the usual legal and linguistic finalisation , and then the directive can be published in the Official Journal of the European Union as soon as possible .

One of the most important aspects of the initiative concerns a fundamental value : respect for cultural and linguistic diversity .
In my own country , Estonia , this fund was not used and , when I asked why it was , I was told that the conditions were very stringent and that the threshold , which was up to now 1 000 people , made this impossible .
I think that together , we will succeed in affirming the fundamental principles that must guide and facilitate future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , it is very worrying to see the increase in the number of cases of lobby and violent attacks on Christians and their communities .
Proposals have also been tabled to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and to monitor in detail what is happening to debt , to strengthen economic governance in the euro area by the Eurogroup and to create a robust and credible mechanism to prevent excessive debt and to tackle the debt problem for the euro area , which could involve the creation of a European Monetary Fund .

We need to evaluate and understand fully what we have , the respective consequences , what is potentially missing and what is overlapping , so that we can come up with new and better considered measures .

in writing . - The mid-term review of the 2007-2013 financial framework is neither practical nor realistic because of the lack of security associated with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty , the end of this Parliament &apos;s mandate , the outcome of the EP elections and the formation of the new Commission in the context of the current economic crisis .

As the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , we support cooperation in the area of legal immigration , making it clear that , at the same time , we are strengthening our opposition to illegal immigration .

However , it would be better if they had complained about themselves if they complained about European leaders .
I am therefore convinced of the importance of this agreement and confirm my vote in favour of the agreement reached .
Thirdly , having an internal market is a vital factor in terms of security of supply .
We therefore fully agree with the rapporteur &apos;s position expressed in paragraph 40 of her report , where she calls on Turkey &apos; to facilitate the creation of a favourable climate to negotiate by withdrawing the Turkish armed forces and allowing both leaders to negotiate freely about the future of their country &apos; .
In some Member States , patients do not have easy access to even the most basic information on pharmaceutical products that are prescribed to them .

The Union is undemocratic and is therefore not a suitable guardian of human rights .

Taking into account the fact that we have 27 countries with 27 different health systems , the Commission &apos;s proposal , based solely on Article 95 - the famous article of harmonisation - will lead to the dismantling of national health care systems and thus remove the responsibilities of Member States .
We believe that this will be extremely impractical , costly and ineffective , especially in schools where there are children from very different linguistic circles , and that this will not be good to promote the integration of migrants into local communities .

Unless the definition and allocation of emission quotas is proportionate , it will be impossible to avoid any distortion of competition .
Fortunately , this battle is not conducted with weapons , but especially in the economic sector .

The European Union &apos;s accession in Kosovo is gradually being materialised and replaced by the United Nations .
The motion for a resolution contains aspects that we do not agree with in more detail , particularly the promotion of &apos; global carbon trading &apos; , given that this decision has shown that it does not offer advantages to reduce carbon emissions , as well as to create more public-private partnerships , highlighting a significant increase in the share of public investment , thus making use of public funds that serve the benefit of profits and private partnerships .
However , practical issues surrounding an agreement with a country with Congolese size are the source of a variety of concerns .
As far as I am concerned , I believe there is only one race , the human being .
President Mubarak , as he is today - and I respect his long-standing struggle - cannot lead the political transition ; he is dying to ask him to do so and leave Mubarak to settle the bills with the massacre of Elorai today on the streets of Cairo .
The social situation has seen a very beneficial development with a notable growth in the average per capita average , and now an overwhelming majority of Tunisians are meeting the criteria for belonging to the middle class .

Voting time
( DE ) Mr President , the old saying &apos; love the change , but not the amendments &apos; once again prove to be true .
It is certainly possible to help poor regions in the EU and , at the same time , using good projects to tackle climate change , reduce gas emissions and introduce renewable energy sources and modern technological solutions .
All these elements form a whole that enables us - at least in my opinion - to come up with a coherent response .
I would also like to say that the Union should decide to comply with the various useful additional protocols , which concern issues such as opposition to torture and the fight against racism , as well as more effective laws .

The final draft agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday , 20 January 2011 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
However , this application was rejected as &apos; incomplete &apos; by the Commission , and I can confirm that , nearly five months later , the Irish Government has not yet submitted a full application .
In addition , the Bayonne-San Sebastián Basque Eurotown already has little use of international airport , which is far from vulnerable natural handicaps .
Furthermore , the EU &apos;s common agricultural policy will have to be adapted to a new economic and social climate at local and regional level , taking into account the increase in energy costs .
I am grateful that I have been given the opportunity to take responsibility and that , as a citizen , I am , of course , still responsible for Brandenburg , which is a boy of mood , for a united Germany , my homeland and for a Europe whose unity will define our destiny and our future .
The ECR welcomes this debate .
The examples that our fellow Members have taken are sufficiently beautiful and we see that Turkey is still a very long way to go to meet EU standards .

If there are different opinions regarding the IMF &apos;s intervention and when the discussions continue , interest rates will automatically increase .
Mr President , Commissioner , today we are coming to an end with which we got bogged down 10 years ago ; I still remember the indignation that caused the Erika accident in December 1999 : the speed with which Commissioner de Palacio submitted proposals at the time , which helped to the Council , under pressure from public opinion , contributed to the drawing up of the first two legislative packages , including my own control , for the other part , and the monitoring of my own asylum policy , including those for June 2002 .
I would like to thank all those who contributed to this .
Mr President , firstly , please accept the apologies of Mr Šefčovič and Mr Oettinger , who have other commitments and asked me to represent them .

Mr President , you have seen the situation yourself , but it continues to exist - it is a collective punishment by Israel over innocent people there .
I do not overlook the fact that we have the European Rail Traffic Management System ( ERTMS ) , the Single European Sky ( SESAR ) and the European Satellite Navigation Management Programme ( Galileo ) , but , in my opinion , we do not see the users &apos; approach to consumer information ; the accessibility of people with reduced mobility and the European satellite navigation programme ( Galileo Satellite navigation ( which , as well as a major problem today &apos;s energy performance ; and the introduction of transport for today , which is essential to consumers &apos; transport ; and the introduction of energy transport , as those who are all those who require .
This is a reality that we can be sure of .
But it is a political parliament , and we are all doing a great deal of political work as far as we can .
Mr President , for the welfare of those efforts that we have made here in Parliament on the rights of animals transported must not be ignored any more .

In particular , this includes the question of legislators .
Instead of saying one year after the earthquakes , we should , in fact , say one year from the earthquakes because it was first the seismic earthquake , then the earthquake with regard to the chaotic distribution of aid , following the health earthquake with the cholera epidemic , then the political earthquake , with the opaque elections , which took place in perhaps the most inappropriate time and now the earthquake that has been held in connection with the former commonautaire and with some historical relationships , and with the returning to the former commonautar .
This means that if it continues to apply the same guidelines , policies and pressure to Portugal and other countries with weaker economies , the differences will deepen and our situation will become increasingly serious due to a lack of solidarity in the European Union .
The Commission is developing an integrated maritime policy , including on the outside political front , as well as integrated maritime surveillance of sectors and borders , in order to acquire a clear idea of maritime action influencing , together with a number of other factors , maritime safety and security , and the implementation of common legal regulations .

On 16 November 2010 , Hungary ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia .

Similarly , when we promote clean technologies , multinationals are resorting to traditional technologies to sell them at a high price to the very people who invented them .

We would like to finally break with a time when the concept of stability was used as a bargaining coin when the concept of stability was used to obtain concessions in the areas of human rights and the principles of democracy .
Mr President , Mr Parish rightly reminded us of what we have mentioned many times in this House , namely the fact that the way in which we treat animals reflects ourselves - to what extent we are &apos; cultural &apos; and civilised .
In my opinion , the Doha Round is of paramount importance to international trade and can make a major contribution to reducing poverty in developing countries and to more fairly sharing the benefits of globalisation .
Unfortunately , it is the last too often the subject of falsification and often not having an active substance , but only a sugar and assistant substance for the rights of the tapeworm .
It will , of course , continue to benefit from the Cohesion Funds , as it is one of the countries benefiting from these cohesion funds , which is different from the EU &apos;s 2020 strategy .
Ágnes Hankiss is accused of a private sadder of alleged crime of defamation committed publicly and , in particular , of defamation of the memory of a person who died , the father of the sad .
We also have an ambassador Creffen among us , who is also involved in the negotiations .
The resolution on equality between men and women in the European Union is , in my opinion , completely balanced and I congratulate Mr Tarabella on the work he has done and the result achieved .
The future of this complex exercise is far from clear .

I would like to ask the Commission , Commissioner and the European Parliament to thoroughly examine and condemn any practice in EU territory that can be used for ethnic or racial discrimination .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the most important issue is , of course , what we do now .
The role of the European Parliament is to decide on this issue .
In 2008 , when I was a member of the Latvian Parliament , I tabled a proposal amending the criminal law for greater responsibility for domestic violence against women and children .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
I am delighted that the exceptions in question will not be used in practice , as there are safe alternatives which not only consumers but also professionals will prefer to choose for the future .
Secondly , the use of construction materials that are harmful to health , such as asbestos , must be avoided at all costs .
In other words , this debate is the result of the need for caution and , above all , of the conclusions we have all drawn from the analysis of the success achieved in Detroit .
Finally , I would particularly like to emphasise the development of the maritime corridors and the proposal tabled by Greece last summer on the creation of a transport observatory in the eastern Mediterranean established in Greece .
The European Union will perhaps learn a lesson from the EUR 2 billion that the Euro-African Development Fund brings to Africa .
Adjournment of the members of the Treaty seems to depend on the direction of the drain .
I support this report , which will also allow Romania to have access to funds to promote the social inclusion of marginalised people , including Roma in both urban and rural areas .
I would point out that we are talking about international waters here and that Limiting Jerusalina , the Danish Foreign Minister , has also stated unequivocally that this is unacceptable .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
I hoped that during this session Parliament would approve the appointment of José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission for another five-year mandate .
Council and Commission statements on establishing a mechanism providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balance of payments .
At the same time , however , the country was left without health professionals , the majority of whom are Bulgarians .
Large monetary interests , be they economic or financial , and major powers always face the idea of cohesion .
The Czech Government , including the President , has every right to say and do whatever it wants , but it cannot forget that it is part of the European Union and that it is already talking on behalf of nearly 500 million citizens and 27 Member States .
This leads to financial problems , a sharp limitation of investment opportunities and loss of competitiveness , especially for small and medium-sized enterprises .
Finally , we believe that the IPA is a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising financial assistance to candidate countries and potential candidate countries .
In the meantime , we should introduce sanctions such as freezing Austeria and banning travel .
We are familiar with these practices and our proposals are aimed at preventing hidden advertising , which can be found in many areas of life .
This year , we see once again how Russia is threatening to break the gas supply and there are signs that we will have to be prepared for this possibility every winter in the future .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for his willingness to make some compromises at the last minute .
Mr President , I welcome President Barack Obama &apos;s decision to attend this EU-US Summit this month in Lisbon , and I voted in favour of the resolution today .
The administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political repression , executions - all these methods are incompatible with the obligations of the People &apos;s Republic of China as a member of the United Nations .
It does not sound convincing , as this is one of the hundreds of arrests of opponents of the regime and part of the systematic repression against all manifestations of dissent .
There is absolutely no point in this .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current difficult economic and financial scenario , Europe must continue to support projects in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector for a sustainable and socially competitive economy .
I believe that the debate on the Single Market and the Services Directive and on how everything is connected to patients &apos; rights was very interesting .
With regard to the Tobin Tax and the tax on financial transactions , you are right : perhaps Mr Tobin first place is not exactly the case .
Furthermore , I would like to stress that I was delighted to learn that Turkey is so close to the hearts and minds of the members of my colleague , Madlener , the Dutch Party for Freedom .
As stated in the latest conclusions of the Council , human rights must always be considered on these high-level visits and , where appropriate , the meetings with the peaceful democratic opposition will form part of these visits .
However , the only thing to which Kozloduy was an example is how old reactors can be safe and function perfectly .
With regard to the Danish Government &apos;s programme relating to the control of the Danish internal borders mentioned by Mrs Koppa , you should , of course , be informed that the President of the Commission immediately sent a letter to the Danish Prime Minister stating that the first analysis by the Commission raised serious doubts about whether the proposed measures will comply with the obligations of Denmark in accordance with European and international legislation .
The European Commission , as the guardian of the Treaty on European Union , must ensure that all Member States comply with the provisions of the regulation and provide the necessary information in good time about the expected development of energy infrastructure .
This is an extremely clear signal from the European institutions that the citizens of Europe do not agree with the cruel treatment and killing of animals .
Mr Morel has done a wonderful job as a special representative , but this is not enough .
Coming back to the meeting with the participation of the members of the Court of Auditors , I remember that they promised to work closely with Parliament .
For many private enterprises and public transport programmes , the additional costs will also lead to two things : higher tickets prices for consumers and a reduction in routes .
However , I see our lights and sessions in the reports .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
We do not want that .
I invite the rapporteur to present an oral proposal to recognise the usefulness and effectiveness of stakeholders who base their activities on Christian faith .
( The sitting was closed at the session of the European Parliament at 23.00 )
It is not possible , for example , to say that the establishment of migrant women should be supported , especially when it is not really certain whether they are legal or illegal immigrants .
We agree with the objectives , as we also agreed with the Lisbon Strategy .
I believe that in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on human rights , the question must be asked whether the indigenous peoples of the Arctic , who live in the Russian Federation , are sufficiently involved in the work of the Arctic Council .
In its decision , the Court made a number of comments about how to improve the procedures for listing by the UN Sanctions Committee on al-Qaeda and the Taliban .
I would therefore like to thank all the Members who have been involved in this work , the shadow rapporteurs , the rapporteurs and all others .
In a situation where the economic situation of countries such as Greece weakens the euro , Mr Draghi &apos;s will and determination to maintain a stable course for a strong currency are indispensable to ensure the confidence of our economy .
Discrimination based on religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation has no place in European society .
The first concerns the need to reach a legally binding agreement .
We have some preconception of it with the adoption of a regulation on hedge funds yesterday in Ecofin .
Welcome
I voted in favour of this report because money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund goes to workers affected by mass redundancies .
Part of this policy must be the EU &apos;s ability to respond to any potential sudden supply crisis .
The aim of this aid is to improve the living conditions of the peoples of beneficiaries , recommending and providing them with all these instruments , which will ensure that these countries will take the path to economic growth and accountability .
The solution is therefore to do far better in the future , and the next option will be in Mexico this year .
That is a fact .
The laws on blasphemy which provide for the death penalty are incompatible with the common values that we seek to promote in our relations with Pakistan .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution calling , in particular , on the Member States to take steps to help slow down the development of the disease in sufferers , for example , by promoting the idea of a healthy lifestyle and guaranteeing treatment for all the ill - to establish specialised centres , to provide , at national level , sufficient medical equipment , and to draw up strategic plans for research in this area .
There is no stability without solidarity .
Since January , 23 000 immigrants have entered Italy .
Thanks to the Maltese Day , the Jewish Refugee Service and many Christian organisations , governments recognise their duty to tackle the fate of the refugees .
That is why the Stockholm Summit next week will focus on areas - as has already been said - where there is a common interest , for example , climate change and energy , as well as the global economic crisis .
In a world that moves quickly towards a new digital era , Europe must prepare itself for the latest broadband infrastructure , which will actually define economic growth on tomorrow .
Madam President , today we voted on the review of the Green Paper on the future of the trans-European transport network policy .
As a member of the SOTA , I believe that it is very important for a project which aims to effectively manage natural resources , to establish reliable statistical database .
Last but not least , I would like to touch on relations between international trade and climate change .
The act proposes various measures , some of which may be beneficial to small businesses , but overall will lead to increased EU control , population unrest , feminist policies and the insickness of EU officials in businesses for professional experience .
This exception is being proposed to tackle a crisis that is obvious to everyone and that we have discussed many times .
The clear link between public finances and the financial and economic crisis is obvious .
Over these 15 years , the 18 countries that signed the UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality have managed to mark some progress in all 12 problematic areas defined in the document .
2009 enlargement strategy concerning the countries of the Western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey ( debate )
All actors should bona de fifa benefit from the opportunities presented in the negotiations in Geneva .
I understand that the figures that have been reported as an amount of illegal trade to the European Union in the form of cigarettes amount to EUR 9.5 billion , and 97 % of which are uncovered .
I also welcome the reference to the initiative on project bonds , which I consider to be a useful tool for growth and development in such a strategic sector as infrastructure .
The requirements have been met by Bulgaria and Romania , and I congratulate Mr Coelho on combining freedom of movement with citizens &apos; security in his balanced report , which was adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We are deciding what needs to be done in this area , but let us not forget that in terms of financial assistance , the fight against the crisis lies first .
But do you really believe that small and medium-sized enterprises believe that this is what the European Union is doing ?
They came to Brussels to tell Parliament that , if we pass legislation on alternative investment as it has been developed , we will reduce the funding of their organisation by two thirds .
The key words will undoubtedly be &apos; added value &apos; , &apos; consistency &apos; , &apos; flexibility &apos; and &apos; clarity &apos; .
There are , of course , other different means of tackling the crisis , but I am sure Commissioner Almunia is prepared to discuss this further with you in the future opportunity .
I support this report because forests , which cover more than 42 % of the EU &apos;s area , provide a livelihoods to many workers and businesses in the forestry sector .
He knows perfectly well that it is unfortunately the governments of the Member States that decide on the seats of the institutions and unfortunately , under the chairmanship of the former leader of his party , John Maystadt , at the Edinburg Summit in 1992 , they imposed a legal obligation on the European Parliament to have an additional 12 sessions a year in Strasbourg .
The committee considered that the luxury industry should not be included in the scope of the ongoing evaluation procedure at European level for certain anonymous counterparts of certain agents because of the different course of action .
We have always maintained that there needs to be reconciliation dialogue and that dialogue needs to continue .
It is reasonable first to reach agreement on the broad parameters of the EU 2020 strategy , and then to introduce the budget review from the new Commission so that the new College has full rights to the proposal and work with you in very close cooperation with regard to future financial perspectives .
Given the lack of a European policy to support the shipbuilding sector , levels of production are not expected to return to the levels seen before the start of the current crisis .
There is no point in continuing to push for the development of the Lisbon Strategy when the economic and social crisis , which has helped to implement this strategy , is deepening .
If the status quo is given , after twenty years , no rail freight remains available .
I also cannot fail to mention the intense negotiations that required this proposal , especially the rapporteur , Mr Rangel .
Since volcanic ash can block the engines of aircraft and prevent the visibility of aircraft , the European Aviation Safety Organisation , Eurocontrol , has taken a responsible approach and made passenger safety a top priority .
It is therefore a legislative package that reconciles health and the environment with competitiveness and innovation , rather than opposing them , as is all too often the case .
I am rather sceptical about the voluntary collection of equipment by producers .
The results of the analysis are expected to be reflected in the subsequent report on decent work to be published in 2011 .
I recognise that it is not ideal and that there are things that give rise to concern .
Apart from the poverty that still unfortunately exists , we are also concerned about global environmental issues , such as climate change , and now we are essentially also talking about something like global insurance to compensate for the victims for the damage suffered by the financial disaster and economic damage .
In conclusion , I would like to wish Commissioner Kovács every success in future endeavours .
However , we do not support the texts on increasing agricultural aid through POSEI for EU producers affected by the agreement .
I believe that , with these functions , European diplomacy will be able to play a more active and decisive role in defending the EU &apos;s fundamental interests , which also concern energy security .
I would like to emphasise once again that the citizens of the European Union are watching with interest how we will observe the universal approval of the Treaty of Lisbon .
We in the June List believe that a multiannual programme or a European Agency for linguistic Diversity and the study of languages at EU level will not change anything about the approximately 500 million inhabitants of Europe , except that it will further increase the burden on taxpayers .
However , this legitimate issue has become a certain element - to put it frankly - of an interinstitutional war that has been going on between the European Parliament and the Council for years .
You have to accept that one of the reasons why the Commission has so badly planned , poorly designed , inappropriate or poorly drawn up proposals that we in England and in other countries have to put up with is the lack of transparency .
Can you understand that !
However , for the families affected - the families affected and those who have been seriously injured - would not be very comfortable if we continued to claim that rail transport is the safest form of transport and that the number of accidents is too low compared with that on the roads .
However , we also call for the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit to resolve the problem of visa requirements re-imposed by the Canadian Government for EU citizens from the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania .
The European Parliament has an important role to play .
It goes without saying that the new strict framework will have to be applied by the countries neighbouring the European Union until now , of course , when we succeed in liberating ourselves , once and for all , from the nightmare of nuclear power plants .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
Ladies and gentlemen , under the terms of the EP EP Election Act , I declare the first meeting of the European Parliament following the elections to the open .
I voted in favour of this report because economic stability can also lead to political stability in the region , which has been extremely controversial over the years .
Parliament has also improved the text , highlighting the importance of training for legal professionals for the cooperation and approximation of our legal structures through mutual recognition and trust , so that we can unite our instruments to find solutions in order to make the European Union a genuine area of freedom , justice and security .
Why is it so difficult to say that for people in the Middle East , the case should be the same ?
Mr President , this debate is very timely for tourism , the aviation industry and consumer protection .
I therefore support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals aimed at striking a balance between privacy and the security of individuals on the Internet , with full respect for their fundamental rights and freedoms .
Of course , this is democracy : we are debating this issue , and it is counterproductive .
I am pleased that the European Parliament can finally enter the most attractive theme and debate what kind of orientation we need in the future and we must adopt accordingly .
The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional financing more flexible ; it must do so now so that the Roma can also benefit from it .
They must also be justified by legitimate interests : national security , public safety , preventing disorder or crimes , health and moral protection , etc .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I represent the High Commissioner and the Commission .
We must act quickly , not only with regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - which we will be discussing shortly - but also with regard to Iraq .
Finally , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is very disappointed that , on the eve of the summit , Russia imposed a disproportionate ban on imports of vegetables from the EU .
It also shows that the burden of over-regulation , which singles the image of the EU , is often not the fault of the EU institutions , but of the Member States themselves .
This draft language law jeopardises the use of minority languages in every single area of everyday life , which also affects , for example , half a million local Hungarian minority living there .
Currently , the dairy sector is going through a crisis of unprecedented proportions : production prices have fallen drastically , consumer prices have risen and many farms in the EU are struggling for their survival .
We welcome the rejection of the proposal by the European Commission , chaired by Mr Durão Barroso , which sought to exclude self-employed workers active in road transport from the Directive on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities as a result of our proposal to reject the Commission &apos;s proposal .
In this context , prominent Europeans , political parties , the public with their demonstrations and European trade unions , claim that Eurobonds can play a key role in overcoming the debt crisis and in safeguarding the stability of the euro .
We should not now lower this level .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Explanations of vote
Secondly , we want to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers .
SMEs are the motto of the European economy , providing sustainable growth and creating numerous jobs .
Other points , such as the proper alignment of an appropriate burden in German , as provided for in the Treaties , have been ignored .
The longer we have been left with no agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme , the greater the risk of a terrorist attack that could have been prevented .
Mr President , this is a repeating debate in this House .
This also means strengthening the education sector , investing in education , research and technological development , which are the cornerstone of a sustainable social market economy and a sustainable and greener economy .
It is regrettable that this resolution comes a long time after the statements of some Heads of State or UN officials concerning the deployment of tens of thousands of US soldiers in the country .
The costs and bureaucracy associated with mistaken policy on multilingualism will further increase with further expansion of the EU .
This has not been done .
This may seem a very distant objective , but if the Burmese people of Burma can learn something from us in the European Parliament , it is that the light of freedom can never be burnt with tyrants and that freedom , which is their inalienable right , will surely be their day again .
What we need is to address the issue of solidarity with each other , with a coordinated approach , not everyone for themselves , and not try to sabotage others .
The programme will be followed by three documents on broadband : firstly , a communication on broadband , which describes the implementation of the broadband programme in detail ; secondly , a recommendation on the next generation of access networks , the aim of which is to clarify the basis for promoting high-speed investments ; and , thirdly , the first radio spectrum policy programme , which will form the basis for the Commission &apos;s strategy , which will generate sufficient broadband Internet spectrum investment .
The aim of the directive is very clear : we need more organs for patients and we need closer cooperation between Member States on this issue and in the fight against organ trafficking .
Too little has been done during the banking rescue process to respond to this predictable development .
As far as production and employment are concerned , today there are only a few low levels in the average / bitter scope , luxury and highly technological sectors .
Defence also suffers when , in the summer , the government is putting its banks at the stress test , and only a few months later , it is realised that this is actually a stress test for the euro , not for the banks .
I very much welcome the adoption of this report because , given the fact that it contains measures to promote research and innovation that are the engines of the current and future growth of the European Union , it expresses the general opinion of the people for whom it will have the greatest importance : the need to simplify and monitor the administrative aspects of the projects , while also strengthening the process of scientific and technological assessment .
Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
I believe that political parties and parliamentary groups that are against populism and demagogy must speak more .
On the subject of the current emergency measures , I would like to draw attention to the fact that increasing the minimum subsidies from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 could create problems for the Member States in more difficult situations with regard to the budget .
( The sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m. )
I would ask you , in your concluding comments , to address some of these very important issues so that people can see that they are discussed .
You have just referred to five points , but the context - the idea that Europe 2020 will mean that economic , social and environmental problems will also be addressed - is being lost , or at least we are in danger of that happening .
Those are not my words .
As a result , the vast majority is now in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon , including the majority of your own people .
We must therefore be careful .
We must fight this and help the people who are being punished in this way .
I am sorry , it is not possible .
I believe that restrictive measures and sanctions are an important instrument of EU foreign and security policy policy policy policy and also , of course , on matters of justice and the protection of fundamental human rights .
This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises , which are the backbone of our economy .
( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , but I would like to raise an important issue with regard to it .
We supported this resolution with a clear aim of conveying the message that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs are side by side with the Haitian people in long-term work to rebuild the infrastructure , communities and people affected .
Of course , we are determined to maintain our support for such actions and to continue to work on this issue in the European Union , not only in the context of the prevention of violence and the support of victims , but also in the areas of immigration , asylum and criminal justice .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Many of them are jointly guilty of Guantánamo , for example because of the departure permits over their territories for the illegal transportation of prisoners .
Under this programme , trade policy remains a very important means of addressing the opportunities and challenges of globalisation and promoting economic growth , jobs and prosperity of all European citizens .
Therefore , let us say , on our part , that the obstacles must be removed .
I would like to add a problem area , namely the admission of products produced outside the European Union .
Unfortunately , one realises that behind all these measures the deliberate intention to conceal the irresponsibility that still exists in our institutions , including in the form of a vague mandate .
I would like to add to this some political aspects that are important because , as has already been said , Tunisia is a society with a multi-party policy , albeit in a limited form and a quota for the opposition , perhaps , but perhaps a party policy .
We had a problem with the appointment of 18 additional MEPs , because some Member States had not actually provided for a procedure , but we decided that representation was the most important issue , that this was the principle that we should guide ourselves , and that a balanced representation should be achieved in Parliament as soon as possible .
As has already been said here , the prudent use of the land , economic and social development in harmony with nature and increased cohesion in the European Union are also vital factors in preventing disasters .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and I look forward to making progress in this relationship .
The legal texts before us not only define the framework and give us basic guidelines , they show the real , concrete measures to be taken in the future .
Furthermore , I think that we need to go beyond the limits of the current proposal to greening the internal market , for example , by using green public procurement .
I am thinking of the importance of the amendment proposing how the issue of observers can be resolved , bearing in mind that these observers must be chosen among the main candidates who have not been elected to the European elections .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s resolutions : see Minutes
We can talk about 2020 , but now we have a more urgent problem : the eurozone and Greece .
Information and communication technologies ( ICT ) are an important sector , not least due to the proportion they fill in the European economy : they employ 7 % of the labour force - from Europe &apos;s labour force - and they account for 6 % of GDP , which is a significant proportion of the European economy , and also of the production and labour force in Europe .
I believe that we can expect many initiatives to ask the Commission to do more , requesting that it has more powers for Europe , and certainly the Commission will respond enthusiastically to this request .
Because if we do not assume our responsibility and take a clear course , we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier : we need to realise that in 2020 - and this we have laid down in the Digital Agenda - every European should be able to pursue its or its interests by means of what they ultimately have been spectrum options .
Such organisations build their son base by reacting to people &apos;s everyday needs and then consolidating their power through terror .
Statements by the President
I supported the Commission &apos;s radio spectrum policy programme ( RSPP ) because I believe that , by 2020 , all EU citizens should have access to faster broadband .
The consequences of the unlimited exploitation of its natural resources would be disastrous , not only for the neighbourhood and local populations , but for the whole world .
( RO ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Győri on the mandate that she currently has and wishing her well and the Hungarian Presidency .
Furthermore , we must continue our work on nanomaterials and , once the issue of cloning has already been resolved , we must continue with them quickly .
The beneficial partnership is particularly important in financial services , economic governance , implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy , energy and the internal market .
With regard to emerging economies - China , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia - they are also making commitments at national level , which outweigh the expectations of the scientific community .
The protocol provides for the Union to pay to São Tomé and Príncipe EUR 682 500 per year , of which EUR 227 500 will be earmarked for supporting São Tomé and Príncipe &apos;s fisheries policy , which I consider appropriate .
We will see how it will be applied in the future .
I also hope that the Council will take more seriously Parliament &apos;s efforts in this regard , although I am very saddened and alarmed at the fact that the representative of the Council is no longer present .
If we , as Europeans , want to play an active role in this regard , it is essential that we continue to do so .
This report is another step forward to push the European Council , the Commission and the Member States forward with regard to homelessness .
For example , in the event of family expulsion , it must be possible to choose whether or not to follow the expulsion of the person or not .
This terrible agreement was concluded in August and ratified in the 1980s .
The negotiations with Japan , which aims to strengthen trade relations , cannot be used as a class weapon in the service of large financial institutions and companies promoting the increasingly active exploitation of workers and peoples , the destruction of their productive power and the destruction of the environment .
We confirm that we will fulfil our obligations and honour the commitments undertaken on the IIA to reform the budget by the end of this year .
During the period between July and August alone in the extraction of the eastern DRC , more than 500 people , including children , girls and women up to 75 years of age , have fallen victim to mass violent rape .
The original draft report , which provided for the realisation of the House of European History with excessively high current costs , was totally contrary to my firm belief in the need for budgetary restrictions when it comes to public funds .
After all , these are investments that do not return straight away , but they are being made to have a reserve .
I would like to emphasise the opportunity to give a helping hand to third countries , as the previous speaker said .
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential , even if it affects only 1 % of the national health budgets , because in addition to the figures we must focus on , it is the power of symbol , which is the legitimate right of every European citizen to be treated abroad and reimbursed the costs of the treatment obtained with all the accurate information .
Nevertheless , as a form of primary prevention , I call for measures to be implemented to promote healthy lifestyles as an extremely important factor in improving health .
In view of the different regulations governing Member States , and often limited application of the provisions of international law in the fight against violence , it is becoming increasingly obvious that clear and binding regulations are needed at EU level .
What is your opinion on these unplanned obligations under the euro system ?
Freedom of expression and information , including freedom of expression and the freedom to obtain and disseminate information without any interference or pressure , are social values for which many people have fought over the years , including Portugal .
I think it is the ones that we can still save the planet .
In short , as we have said so many times , we need a cohesion policy that is robust , well-financed and present in all regions of the European Union .
In general , I share some of these fears and admit that Turkmenistan has yet to go down before fully complying with international standards of democracy and human rights .
An increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of lower labour costs in some countries , particularly China and India , with disastrous consequences for countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Ladies and gentlemen - I am addressing , in particular , my colleagues from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) - there is no point in defending one or another group in Ukraine for party political reasons .
( The sitting was closed at 23.45 )
Mr President , the Arab world is our partner in the Union for the Mediterranean .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , with whom we have very close views on the programme and , secondly , to congratulate all those involved , because at a time of economic crisis , it is essential to maintain a programme of this kind with obvious positive social consequences .
The Commission is looking forward to establishing a special relationship with Parliament on this dossier as well .
Mr President , Commissioners , we must ensure that the promises made at the donor conference become real means and that they reach their recipients .
This is the committee which defines the policy towards the citizens , which is particularly necessary in connection with the current crisis .
The European Council must carry out the necessary preparations , but it must not draw premature conclusions .
If there were not the closure of several companies a week after week in Portugal , there would be so many Portuguese people out of work and living in poverty .
By setting up a trust fund , as proposed by the Party of European Socialists , we will ensure that those Member States that are attacked by unscrupulous speculators can be supported without resorting directly to taxpayers &apos; money and ensuring smaller pretexts .
Out of the new cases of violation in 2007 , 1196 refers to a lack of notification of national measures for transposition of Community directives .
I believe that a balance needs to be struck between environmental protection , on the one hand , and , on the other hand , bureaucracy and costs for industry and smaller installations , for example , agricultural and health installations .
The EIB is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of this strategy .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating Mrs Weber for the excellent work she has done on this report .
I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission here seem to share the same views on many priorities .
In fact , it provides the international and domestic road transport patterns of the large monopolies to the test .
- Report : Klaus-Heiner Lehne
If antibiotics are used on such a large scale , it is not surprising that there are bacterial boxes which are not subsequently influenced by antibiotics .
This directive does not accept the principle of the protection of migrant workers and the protection of those who are forced to work under unacceptable conditions send out signals about them .
I am very pleased that we rejected the draft resolution , which has been discussed for the sole purpose of the left being able to attack its political opponents in Italy .
You are absolutely right .
It is true that there have been heated debates in the Council on the best ways to ensure that the Member States on the periphery do not feel excluded , and ultimately the Council is formed , and I hope - and I believe - this discussion has also shown this - also in Parliament .
The adoption of Amendment 43 will not lead to the deletion of Amendment 54 because Amendment 54 also has other issues which do not cover Amendment 43 .
Order of business
Climate change is not the only environmental problem we face , but it is imperative that we try to deal with it in Copenhagen .
However , there is no need for a new body to provide it or to define and monitor the conditions .
- ( HU ) I welcome the Council &apos;s decision on the position to be defended at the G20 summit .
We should decide whether we need new sources of income and , in this case , we should not look forward to those who have always benefited from this unspeakable situation .
in writing . - As a strong opponent of the EU and its constant intervention in our lives , I quite logically voted against the bulk of the reports , which I was called upon to consider .
This cost one million British people their jobs without the need .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is an instrument that is increasingly being used by the European Parliament for the difficult period of economic cohesion that our continent is experiencing .
I want Judge Afiuni and all prisoners in Venezuela to be treated with dignity and to ensure that they are prosecuted in good faith .
Some Members asked about Gaza , to make sure that aid is passed , that we continue to support the people of Gaza - what we are doing , but we are committed to dialogue to increasing and improving it .
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for a more transparent , simpler and fair system of funding in the European Union .
While the European Union must maintain relations with the Russian Government , we must keep reminding this government continually that it follows the democratic state and the democratic era , and that attempts to impose censorship of views that are unacceptable to the government , or putting unacceptable pressure on politicians will be unacceptable to the European Union .
( NL ) Mr President , unfortunately , the giants - the USA , China , India , Brazil - did not join a European giant in Copenhagen .
Mr President , honourable Members , I am convinced that research and innovation are not an option for Europe , but a necessity if we want a long-term solution that preserves our social model and environmental sustainability .
Obviously , the aim is to maintain raw materials in order to achieve more favourable export prices .
Please give it .
Developing countries rightly claim that they did not cause the crisis .
In connection with this , action , the European Union should fulfil its role , considering in good time and in the appropriate form the possible technical measures for complementing UN sanctions and , at the same time , confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue , which should never be lost , even in difficult times .
Since this directive does not seem to have been effective enough in bringing an end to late payments , I also support the strengthening of the existing rules .
Since that time , it was made clear to us , first and foremost , that the US was far more open to reserves and to finding constructive solutions to Europe &apos;s reserves than we thought previously .
In fact , Commissioner Rehn said here that they first have to approve their budget before they are allowed to hold general elections .
I would like to highlight something quite strange : in the United States , the use of hidden in specific additives was banned , but the European Medicines Agency allowed it , since most vaccines contain mackerel .
The most effective means of the European Union for combating unemployment is the European Social Fund , the rules for which we are now significantly simplifying in order to speed up payments .
I believe that we now need to give time to transpose this package : to implement it and to see how it works before deciding whether something needs to be done .
In order to increase cooperation , new areas have been added , such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime ; to prevent actions on the part of issuers ; to fight against the manufacture of so-called &apos; charter and minor weapons &apos; ; and to trade in them ; and to accumulate them ; and to combat migration cooperation .
I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund could harm the transparency of development policy .
The first is that despite all the concerns and fears that people feel , we must not lose sight of the principles .
The resolution explicitly mentions and criticises the measures taken by the current government , but forgets that the current mayor of Naples , Mrs Yerseino , is a member of the centre-left party and - worse - forgets the long-running management of Mr Beijing , who was the mayor of Naples in the 1993-2000 period and the Governor of Campania in the period 2000-2010 , as well as a special member of the waste responsible for many years .
Put yourself and fight for democracy again .
Apart from what has just been said about the precautionary principle and significant traceability , the first point - and it is also about knowing how the general warning to blame Spanish cucumbers was issued without any or almost no evidence .
On this point , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the report is not necessary - too many conditions are placed to obtain prior authorisation , which makes it difficult for Member States .
The future of this region needs stable , tolerant democracies which respect minorities and in which the country has been promised to everyone and is not being abused by a few .
I sincerely hope that Estonia will join the euro area on 1 January 2011 in order to create the conditions for economic growth and financial difficulties .
Therefore , in principle , the vast majority of stakeholders , including professional associations , accepts the &apos; only in English &apos; version .
The only way forward for working men and women is the concern and disobedience of the decisions of the European Union and its institutions .
At the same time , political dialogue is at a standstill .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am tabling an oral amendment to the split vote on paragraph 10 on the following outcome : &apos; considers it inappropriate to include this concept in the protocol as complementary standards on racism , racism , racism , xenophobia and all forms of discrimination &apos; .
We need to raise this target and increase it , but only when the circumstances are suitable .
It is essential that we in the European Union act on the ECOA .
As far as financial services are concerned , I agree with the need for service providers to apply a certain level of transparency , but I have some doubts about the wording used in the project .
The budget underpinning this report - as explicitly stated in the first point of preamble to the compromise proposal , which adopts the end of milk quotas - is unacceptable to us , which is why we voted against .
Madam President , this is indeed good news .
We will not endeavour to clarify everything .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to point out that I cannot make my speech in Catalan , because it is not yet an official language , even though it is a language of more than ten million European citizens .
The Union must modernise its energy infrastructure and link the energy infrastructure of the Member States .
If Russia cannot accept Ukraine &apos;s political direction , it must accept it , as it has overcome the loss of its political influence on the countries of the Socialist bloc .
In this context , I would like to remind you of the decision adopted yesterday afternoon in plenary , rejecting a resolution on the case of Aminatou Haidar so that we do not compromise the current diplomatic negotiations .
Mr President , we are discussing the situation in Belarus , but let us not pass responsibility .
The main producer countries , with the support of the majority of Members who are sensitive to the arguments of this industry , have managed to prevent us from setting an ambitious target for reducing emissions .
We have achieved excellent cooperation in drawing up this report , which I believe is very strong and which presents a clear idea of the direction in which Parliament wants the CAP to go after 2013 .
The US example shows that flexibility is not synonymous with uncertainty , but rather a dynamic labour market market .
As President of the European Commission , I am signing up to the principles laid down in the resolution that you have just adopted .
We must now give a clear signal regarding the accountability of those who hold in their hands the future of the Treaty , which is of fundamental importance to the Union , to our institutions and to the 500 million Europeans that we represent .
All these things are examples of the usefulness of animal research .
Documents received : see Minutes
Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work because , in addition to the EUR 146 million agreed , the effect of which will hopefully be eight times higher , this initiative also has important symbolic significance .
I believe that Europe &apos;s cultural spirit is an important way of bringing Europe closer with full respect for the various cultural and linguistic identities .
I believe it is very important to promote not only competitiveness in the agricultural sector , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution .
Special derogations have also been authorised for remote rural areas and islands , similar to Orki and Settland , in my constituency , where greater travel expectancy is unavoidable .
The policies put in place give rise to anger and frustration among our citizens , and decision-making procedures invalidate their participation in the elections , as the last European elections have shown .
With regard to the delay , you are right : there is some delay .
The resolution calls on the Commission to respond immediately to the legitimate concerns of the petitioner , who has been in this intolerable situation for 13 years , and has therefore suffered major losses in resources , and to take the necessary action to allow the petitioner to defend his rights .
The way to achieve this is to fully support , effectively implement and have sufficient respect for existing laws and instruments relating to the protection of human rights and civil liberties .
Never before has the European project been tested to such a difficult test .
What will we do when the Americans , because the dollar is falling , start selling their high cost , subsidised and publicised cars 4x4 into our market , which is also about the cheapest vehicles from Turkey , India and China ?
Mr President , I would like to ask you to give your assessment of the EU-Ukraine summit that took place almost two weeks ago .
We want common , European solutions .
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out , in order to clarify these aspects , the Commission should consult Parliament when providing a mandate .
It is very important for us , as Europeans , to ensure that we send the European message to Belarus , thereby offering hope there .
The new European Neighbourhood Policy that we have been promised is simply a continuation of the old , with a few additional generous democratic luxury .
It is obvious that these measures only offer a partial , incomplete solution to illegal immigration and irregular work .
Do not be under any illusions : we are making it absolutely clear , I say very clearly to all the leaders with whom I am talking , what I believe needs to be done and I do with the support of this Parliament and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States .
I do not exaggerate : in one of the reports , it is considered necessary to point out that , in the event of a change in the majority following elections , the new government must be authorised before amending the budgetary priorities of previous government , and even then it can do so only superficially .
While our political differences remain unchanged , our relationship with people has been enriched considerably .
For this reason , it is important for us to go far beyond the pilot project that you referred to , Commissioner .
Basically , in the area of nuclear power , things are such that each country has its own regulator responsible for nuclear safety , on which the implementation of nuclear safety measures depends fully .
But it is interesting , although it is true , because of the financial crisis , a number of countries have problems , it is also true that - I think Mr Lamberts will recognise it and evaluate - that in most countries with constant views on public finances , governments are not socialist .
Various scenarios are possible , from peacefully seizing power from pro-democratic powers to economic chaos and outbreaks of armed conflict , and even the use of nuclear weapons cannot be ruled out .
In an ageing population , the number of cases of neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer &apos;s , or old dementias , will continue to rise .
On the subject of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and on the subject of the changes to the European Social Fund , I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation , because the dialogue was so constructive that the achievement of our objectives is quite marked within this meeting , and I consider this to be extremely important .
And what are you going to say about encouraging Member States , even when they make applications to mobilise the EGF , to implement the measures they have submitted for application within the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , because this would guarantee , at the very least , that workers will not wait for the mobilisation of the fund ?
These strategies and programmes cannot remain just on paper because they would only serve to see the inconsistency and lack of trust in the acts adopted by the European Union itself .
I cannot imagine how anyone can feel well by doing this oppressive regime a favour of the amendments that enable Iran to attack and weaken the opposition movement advocating human rights and democracy in Iran .
I voted against the introduction of EU contract law because I do not believe that Brussels should produce legislation in the area where national legislation already exists .
With his election as president , he brought hope and change not only to the United States , but to the whole world , as well as to Europe .
From this point of view , I support the proposals presented to Parliament by the Commission ; many of them have already been affected in my report on the Community Code on the Movement regime across borders .
However , we have objections to the wording in paragraph 8 , which states that a gradual and sharp reduction in the tax burden on average and low salaries and pensions - through tax deduction , a review of rates and a compensation for tax .
In many cases , when the government of a country has not participated in dialogue or in programmes to improve the situation mentioned , the resolution on a country remains the only action that the international community can take against these crimes .
We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new Parliament .
However , these exceptions must only apply where they can be justified because of their importance in relation to security policy .
The Co-Chairs also called on the LTTTE to overthrow the arms , but unfortunately this call was rejected , it was not even taken into account .
I agree with the opportunity to make calls for structural reforms in countries with surplus , but the greatest attention must be paid to deficit countries .
I would therefore like to ask for a roll-call vote on the second part of paragraph 12 .
However , I am delighted that Parliament has shown such a clear determination by such a clear majority to solve the problem in the way it has now done .
This is our European path and it can differ from others .
The project called the European Antibiotic Medicines Network ( ESVAC ) has started over the last four months of 2009 .
Given the key role that research plays in economic development and job creation , it is important at all costs to avoid excessive bureaucracy and unjustified delays which prevent the participation of the scientific community .
The banks report large profits , but they are cheaped when it turns out that they voluntarily help Greece .
This document shows that Member States are increasingly managing to transpose EU law .
The best way to reduce the population &apos;s growth is to save children &apos;s lives , so that people do not feel the need to have larger families .
I therefore welcome the proposal to establish clear rules for defining the aforementioned categories of wine products so that European produce can always be seen and recognised .
This initiative will only be successful if it is easily implemented and accessible to all .
I believe that particular attention should be paid to corridor 7 .
We therefore warmly welcome this communication , which shows new ambitions for policies on the Single Market and enables us to restore confidence in our model of the social market economy .
( The speaker agreed to take a question to another Member under Rule 149 ( 8 )
As you know , there was a second round of presidential elections on Sunday in Ukraine .
The Hungarian Government should ensure effective guarantees of freedom and pluralism in the media , and should therefore repeal the law or significantly amend it on the basis of the observations and proposals of the OSCE , the Commissioner for Human Rights , the Council of Europe , the Council of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights , as well as through an open , transparent debate , in which all the parties involved ( NGOs ) and NGOs ) .
The Prüm Treaty was incorporated into European law without proper democratic control .
I would also like to remind our liberal colleagues , and in particular Mr Rohde , that the reason why he supports free trade lies in her devastating consequences , because he claims that the fact that the English storm was moved by dishonourable interests was unfounded was insignificant : Indian society had to be destroyed to allow the beginning of the world revolution .
Ladies and gentlemen , Kenya acts in conflict with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human Rights and the peoples .
Firstly , civil protection falls within the remit of the Member States , and all the coordination initiatives must be citizens on this basis .
In 2008 , the United Nations Special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions wrote that murders led to the elimination of civil society leaders , including human rights defenders , members of trade unions and supporters of the deplorable reform , to the intimidation of a large number of civil society activists and to the political discourse of the country .
I do not agree with the last speaker because I believe that , if we adopt the Treaty of Lisbon , it will enable us to have a more significant link between citizens and the EU .
We are at the highest level with regard to civilisation and weapons , more than we did during the Cold War , which is far from pragmatic policy of movement towards disarmament .
This will allow us to say that we will establish real , effective economic governance for the benefit of all Member States .
I believe - and this is the positive message that will take away with it - if this Parliament follows our example tomorrow - I hope with a full majority - that we have ensured that control really is carried out .
Moreover , we have tried to make our wish , not only for high quality and attractive content stations as possible , but also for the integration of new platforms , bearing in mind the latest technologies .
Madam President , in Ireland two years ago , in December 2008 , we had a problem .
Although we cannot expect miracles from this agreement , it is a step in the right direction and I have therefore voted in favour of this report .
This is again an intergovernmental mechanism that was conceived in Ecofin and which requires unanimity .
This goes against the true objective of regional aid , namely , strengthening the weakest regions .
One symbol , one conclusion - that is the direction in which we all need to work together .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
However , the only way in which we will be able to achieve the necessary scope of applying our actions is through a clear commitment from the Libyan authorities .
Thus , of course , we are sending out a clear signal about the future renewed staff of the institutions - of course Parliament , but also of the Commission .
There is also the risk that true criminals will be on the table using innocent people for drug smuggling or suicide terrorists , or by establishing new routes far from those observed .
Another essential element is greater access to schools , the high level of vocational and university education , and the improvement of social conditions for women in rural areas .
However , there are still challenges .
EPAs will not be satisfactory agreements unless they promote regional integration and help to develop in the ACP countries and achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
In my opinion , the most important aspect in this regard is the need to coordinate a new budget for Europe and for the European Union over the next few years .
The EU must attach fundamental importance to research and innovation in tackling challenges such as climate change and in finding solutions to increasing global competition .
Europe is divided on this issue .
This is good news and we should thank all those who in the Member States and , in some cases , in the regions are responsible for implementing this directive .
The United Nations estimates that 20 % to 40 % of global timber production results from illegal logging .
I know that she will soon leave this place and , although we are not always of the same opinion on the various issues , I think everybody will agree that she has done a huge amount of work on this report .
This proposal , which is supported by the Council of Europe , has been awaited for a long time by all those who are fighting for respect for the rights of integration of marginalised communities , particularly the Roma .
If this is not done , the result will be the illegality of any act adopted by the European Parliament on the basis of a composition of 754 Members - with three boundaries from 751 .
Just recently , however , we have debated the Digital Agenda ; we have all supported the Digital Agenda ; and this issue is of key importance to the Digital Agenda .
I would like to thank you for having made this debate truly general .
Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with the Tribunal is a condition for joining the European Union , but the truth is , as Commissioner Orbán frankly told me last evening in the absence of Commissioner Rehn , that there is no unanimity in the Council on exactly what it means .
The Arctic Council has focused its efforts on environmental cooperation and research , but the agreements on the use of natural resources have led to an increasing need to develop international governance strategies , and the European Union can also have a role here .
However , I strongly support a very strict approach with regard to access to the occupation of the road hauliers .
Having opened our markets when we joined the European Union , we import the same amounts to the budget and many other things besides .
Unfortunately , there is currently no European mechanism or institution with opportunities to coordinate an integrated recovery at continental level , and we are therefore implementing individual solutions which may not be successful in general , as the economies of the Member States are heavily dependent on each other .
Let me just say that , as far as our own communication is concerned , we are presenting a clear definition of price stability , which allows for every constant and in real time to judge what we do ourselves .
On the issue of judicial training , the Council shares Parliament &apos;s view on the need to create a real European judicial culture through , inter alia , to promote the direct exchange of judges , prosecutors and litigers between the various Member States , and to develop the European Judicial Training Network actively .
We should make a joint effort along these lines in the future .
However , this did not happen .
However , I would like to remind the House - we have faced this recently in Greece in connection with important cases - that even now , there are people who are persecuted for serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union which disappear or manage to get away from and escape arrest using the various procedural regulations and various rules in the various national legislations .
A common framework was created where the various elements are complemented and strengthened each other .
Before the vote :
The most important message from our debate today for the Member States must be that Romania and Bulgaria meet the same accession criteria that the European Union has demanded of the countries that have acceded to date .
The existence of contract law at European level , which was discussed in detail in the institutions , could bring a series of benefits to businesses , consumers and the smooth functioning of the internal market .
Politically , it is unacceptable that this report , which contains incorrect facts , was voted on in plenary today ( 24 November 2009 ) .
Indeed , we cannot , on the one hand , for years of order to criticise the United States for the Guantánamo centre and , on the other hand , fail to show more will or ambition to help them solve the problem .
We therefore voted against it .
The emigration triggered by crisis situations and instability has a negative impact on countries of origin , destination countries and the displaced populations themselves .
Madam President , I do not know what actually happened , but I would like to say as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
On Serbia , people residing in Kosovo , as well as people residing abroad and holders of Serbian passport issued by a central body in Belgrade , will be excluded from liberalisation and obligatory to obtain a visa .
Passengers must be able to choose whether to recover the ticket price or to continue their journey under the same conditions and without additional pay .
Ensure that we have binding energy efficiency targets that are actually respected .
I tabled this question on behalf of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport and Tourism because , over the summer months , Members of Parliament , who were very concerned about the bankruptcy of an airline SkyEurope , contacted me to take the initiative on their behalf .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
Firstly , we need to overcome the imbalances that have arisen as a result of the ever-increasing differences in life expectancy and pension age .
Proposals :
What is under discussion is whether we believe that we can gather all the details , including the form of the agreement , in Mexico .
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe quickly favours the functions of the Council of Europe as the main and most relevant forum for discussing democracy - with its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) , which support election observation - human rights and the rule of law in Europe .
The compromise is a good one , and I very much hope that it will be met with broad approval during the vote tomorrow .
I have recently reminded the House that the elections in Belarus are not free , that freedom of expression , association and protest are not there , and that repression by the authorities is increasing .
The preferences must be scientifically substantiated , taking into account all scientific information and taking the evidence into account .
Of course , this information is very important to patients and health professionals , but because of the likelihood that it will be misused for a promotional purpose , it must be placed within a strict framework .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the repeated accidents and the frequent transportation of hazardous goods by sea are continually raising the issue of stricter safety rules in all European Union marine winds and of the resources needed to ensure compliance with these rules .
The second issue relates to nuclear power .
Then there will be the technical part that involves making it a legally binding text .
It is therefore essential that the social clause appears increasingly often in bilateral agreements .
We have a good opportunity here to demonstrate this in practice .
Tuesday :
In order to strengthen practical cooperation , the creation of an Asylum Support Office for the European Pact of 2008 and agreed in the Stockholm Programme in 2009 .
This week we celebrated 8 March .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , thank you to the honourable Member for this point , but I would like to inform her that I am a representative of Poland and not Lithuania .
Mr President , I am delighted to have the opportunity in the end to present the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in plenary - something that was impossible a few weeks ago .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs García Pérez , Mrs Jöns and Mr Angelaka , who have provided excellent reports and all the Members who have spoken .
I know that these events are followed by many Members of the European Parliament , as well as our respective national parliaments throughout Europe .
We will therefore reiterate our call on Russia to do everything it can to ensure that human rights defenders can carry out their activities without having to live in fear of violence , harassment or threats .
Furthermore , unnecessary complications could undermine the legitimacy and popularity of the EU accession process to the Convention .
Opening of the sitting
I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government , which has many other issues to deal with : its refugees - as has been said - and supervision of the democratic transition process .
We must continue to pursue economic , social and territorial cohesion policy in order to bridge the disparities between regions and create a platform for balanced economic development , as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The vote follows .
Groups for the protection of human rights have accused Google of helping the Chinese Government to repress its citizens and , in particular , human rights activists .
The main issue at present is for the rapid amendment of the proposed directive and its implementation as soon as possible .
Faced with such a situation , I propose , as I did before , the creation of the Euroeast Neighbourhood Assembly , with the participation of the European Parliament , based on the principles of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation ( Euromed ) and EuroLat ) , in order to implement the ENPI countries in Eastern Europe .
The main issue that we need to discuss is the financing of the European budget and the future of the financial perspectives .
We need to inform our fellow citizens what this directive means and how they can use the instruments we give them in the face of this directive so that they do not get trapped with the purchase of falsified medicines .
It is very important to create a level playing field for credit rating agencies by stimulating competition , transparency , opening up markets and stability .
It is estimated that between 200 000 and 300 000 children currently participate directly in armed conflicts in over 20 countries around the world .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Espinosa , Commissioner , the Spanish Presidency decided to prepare an assessment of the Copenhagen climate conference , although we say here , in accordance with the many speakers , that it ended in a fiasco .
These improvements are crucial as a way of promoting the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) in the future .
Commissioner , you cited the Lisbon Strategy , innovation , the environmental economy , and you know that this European strategy is failing .
No , it wants to continue to pay export refunds .
( DE ) Madam President , in the case of each individual country , it is important to take account of its origin and of whether events in the area of human rights and minorities move in the right direction .
Furthermore , it is important to encourage fishing companies through legislation to use the best equipment currently available from the point of view of selectivity and to avoid capturing such huge amounts of small overheads and fish from species other than targeted or hunting .
We will continue to strive hard to do this .
As the Commissioner rightly pointed out , for many years our main competitors and economic partners have been indicating the origin of the goods imported into their territory .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , 20 May , at 12 : 00 .
While the EU supports the proposals for Copenhagen to deindustrialise the West and to control us against the Third World , a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as elitary fraud - as an excuse to tax us and to control us , and to impose an internationalist dogma and a global government at the expense of the nation state .
In addition , we are in constant contact with third countries , particularly Russia , to ask them to lift their ban , which is considered disproportionate .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , the proposals being discussed here are like putting a big race on the back of all those who already find the situation difficult enough and , at the same time , communicating to them that they must flee more quickly .
Once again , I welcome their courage and their neutrality .
At the same time , the consequences of the irresponsible budgetary policy currently in force in several Member States will obviously continue to belong to the European Union over the next few years .
First of all , there is the fact that science is world discipline and sharing of achievements in this area foster humanity in general .
I would say : without more rules .
The Romanian Government , whose popularity is sharply collapsing and which is on the eve of a series of restrictive measures with a brutal burden and with a drastic impact on living standards , is resorting to increasingly violent non-democratic methods to hold on .
Let us regain the utopia and the utopia about peace !
We believe that the European Union is on the right track and we want to ensure , through control and transparency , that we achieve the 20 % target and that everything is fine in Europe .
The White Paper also offers more funding opportunities for projects in this area , in particular , in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development , the EU Public Health , the Youth and the Citizens Programme and the Lifelong Learning Programme .
In view of the fact that only seven members are participating in the committee , whose task is particularly responsible , it is important for personalities to be extremely capable of being able to have a record .
Even if we cannot offer them the prospect of recent membership , we must develop economic and political cooperation for the good of the whole of Europe .
Following the public consultation last year , the Commission is carrying out an assessment of collective redress comments and intends to find a solution that satisfies the needs of European consumers without putting into practice the United States .
Mr President , the report is about active dialogue with citizens , and the best active dialogue with European citizens is based on what they say in democratic elections .
I think the debate this evening has shown unusual agreement in Parliament on , for example , the appointment of a special EU coordinator for Tibet .
I hope that the treatment of ethnic minorities from EU countries will be the same as other EU citizens .
It is a wonderful example , a benchmark and a lesson given to us from the second poverty state on the planet : when we entered the courts , we saw the slogan &apos; there is no peace without justice &apos; .
In the current situation , cooperation between the Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council is vital in order to guarantee energy needs and avoid rising the price of oil on the global market .
If we fail to provide a clear response to these questions , the two objectives of growth in employment and reducing the poverty level will follow the fate of the Lisbon Strategy .
- Before the vote :
Mr Amado said that he did not talk about this so that he did not violate the calmness of the European institutions .
I hope that 2010 will be a very good year for Croatia , as well as for the Western Balkans , but I would also like to emphasise the need to consider and address the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons adequately .
I know that it is not easy .
Madam President , I would like to join in calling for this proposal to be withdrawn and for the Commission to come up with a different legal basis .
Many review clauses are proposed in the text to ensure that it works , but I repeat the words of Diana Wallis that exceptions were essential to the compromise .
The position of the Commission is commendable : it makes the Member States responsible for safe management , including the disposal of their spent fuel and radioactive waste produced through the development of their programmes .
I believe that this text represents another instrument for the EU to use , as it outlines a consistent and effective policy on the phenomenon of migration flows , guiding its choice to the most appropriate path towards the reestablishment of conditions for political , economic and social stability .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you to each and every one of you for your points of support and , by the way , this also includes those who opposed this report .
Our third aim is to simplify and facilitate access to financing instruments for the SME sector .
At the same time , Ukraine needs to speed up its reforms .
I would like to emphasise the concerns of the rapporteur , who reflects the concerns of the entire group on young people &apos;s commitment .
We use our competences to protect these rights and freedoms in our work on the basis of the Treaties and we will continue to do so .
The number of errors is falling , but we have not yet reached the tolerable error rate .
Too many children are poor and face health and education problems caused by constant poverty .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is rather a political provocation when the Europe 2020 programme is being presented as a very good strategy for getting out of the crisis further .
We have negotiated the five objectives , including social inclusion , which falls within the competence of the European Union under the Treaty .
Recently , we have seen the importance of this problem , which we have adopted legislation when several million households resume their CRT TV televisions with modern LCD screens .
We must invest in neighbouring countries , especially those in the east of the EU , and offer them the necessary incentives to continue their reforms and thus strengthen the EU &apos;s presence in the area .
It is important that the most effective criteria be set , given the increasing number of equipment produced and its impact on health and the environment when it is not treated at the end of its life cycle .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the issue of information on prescription-only medicinal products is a sensitive subject , because it is important for protecting the health and well-being of all citizens .
Mr Barroso , the President of the European Commission , is responsible for the current financial , economic , food and environmental crisis that is affecting Europe .
First of all , I would like to thank Maria Martens , who has prepared an excellent report on the progress made on the Africa-EU coherent strategy .
I cannot fail to emphasise the need to ensure the quality of products sold in Europe and to guarantee the safety of those who use them .
These conclusions highlight that we need to learn lessons from the disaster in Japan and that we need to review the safety situation of EU nuclear power plants and carry out the stress tests .

We had to set a limit point , but we did not do so and we will now have to go on and hope to hear .

In many aspects , I admire the main positions of my group .
This type of operation is a major step forward , a big step in the right direction .
Can the Commission outline to what extent will it take into account these judicial decisions , which once again show the resistance of air companies , the excessively vague wording of Regulation No 261 / 2004 on &apos; extraordinary circumstances &apos; , which justify repealing flights and the passive attitude of the Commission to the range of infringements of the regulation in question to the detriment of passengers ?

I welcome the measures proposed by the European Commission to support Europe &apos;s dairy farmers .
I believe that there is one thing we can stop doing , and that is stop building on Greece .

It is important for us to be able to tackle this , and the European Parliament resolution adopted today helps to do so .
The Commission will take advantage of the work of the European Institute for Gender Equality , which will collect and analyse information and statistics on the subject .

I , like many others , remain concerned about the transfer of bulk data and indeed about the control of these data once they are out of our hands .
- Report : Paulo Casaca
The way in which progress is made in this area is to improve their skills , for example by channelling EU funds more effectively into youth policies .
To be honest , I find it amazing that we now have to use almost defence arguments , because we cannot consider this solely on the basis of the Euratom regulations , but that we also have to look at protecting consumers , protecting the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants on the basis of the Euratom Treaty rules , so that we have full control and final vote in the final outcome .
Finally , it links European energy security to close cooperation with NATO .
We believe that the European Union and the European Commission should be much more demanding in terms of values that could lead us to a shared peace and security project .

I would like to call on Serbia to make a clearer commitment to employment and social cohesion policies .
The financing of agricultural property in developing countries must be seen as investment costs covered by the EIB &apos;s external credit mandate .
The European Union can play an important role in this , as it is not only its right , but also its duty to insist on full compliance with high environmental standards , as I can well imagine that similar dangerous reservoirs exist in other Member States .
Given that I and the rapporteur on the only report from the European institution on earthquakes , I know perfectly well that a lot can and must be done at European level .

However , it must not be left to take the decisions that are the responsibility of all the Member States in the euro area .
We insist that assisting spouses must be compulsory insurance , as in the case of self-employed workers .
Furthermore , given the fact that the government has lost its access to the financial markets , no assistance would not mean that fiscal policy would be even more restrictive than it is under the programme , and the spending restrictions would be more stringent .
As an example of such dogmas this , I can give the recent article of Václav Klaus , which advises us how to overcome the financial crisis by simultaneously removing social and environmental standards and health standards because , in his words , these standards are hampering human behaviour .
Within the framework of the ongoing discussions , it is important to draw up clear guidelines and protect them , including on behalf of Austria .
Consumers and professionals will have to remove the unwanted scourge by means of one of the many equally effective , but harmless alternative chemicals , or , for example , by means of psychological / mamical removal .
This time , after a long debate , Ireland , a small country such as Finland , sought protection from the European Union and wants to help strengthen it .
From the point of view of budget control , which nowadays also covers the real results and effectiveness of the European programmes and institutions , the EIB certainly deserves its appreciation , particularly as regards its political reliability .
This is a difficult task , but I am sure you will do your best to do it .
I am not the only one that wants to be informed about this .
We have also been following with great concern the reports on the detention of several Tibetan pupils and teachers who took part in a peaceful protest demonstration against the government &apos;s plan for reform in education .

Despite President Yanukovich &apos;s initial actions and subsequent statements by the Ukrainian authorities about Ukraine &apos;s desire to join the EU , to adopt European models of good governance and to respect the human rights and civil liberties of its people , we have to be vigilant to a certain extent .
Only by means of a single approach at EU level can we cope with the growing wines of falsified products that are made accessible to citizens - and yet not only through pharmacies , but also through distributors , which are offered over the Internet .
That is all .
Simplification of access to the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund is an essential part of support for the Member States worst hit by the economic crisis that we are experiencing .
( PL ) Mr President , the European Parliament has adopted resolutions many times condemning cases of violations of human rights and freedoms in various parts of the world .
As you know , in the region as a whole , there has been a significant decline in diplomatic activity to resolve the Gaza conflict : the indirect negotiations between Syria and Israel have been suspended ; Mauritania and Qatar have suspended their relations with Israel ; there has been a threat that the Arab peace initiative has been withdrawn .
Firstly , we are talking about a European Court of Human Rights ruling , which is not a European Union institution , but rather a court of concentration , part of the European Union , but an autonomous state bound by the rule of law , representative democracy and human rights .
We can help by stimulating the markets for new technologies , for example , for clean and energy-efficient vehicles , and help to create harmonised standards for the widespread introduction of new technologies on the market .

This situation causes serious problems both to carriers and to companies in the EU .
Nor can there be a permanent threat under which Israeli children live .
The new President of the European Council will be fully operational from 1 January 2010 and have presented his ideas on how to organise the European Council in the future .
We still do not have a legislative initiative based on the Treaty of Lisbon , but we have been promised a response to our expectations by the Commission .
This instrument will facilitate economic , technical , academic , financial and cultural cooperation , thereby benefiting both the European Union and its partners .
Climate change , as I have said many times , is an urgent and serious issue which requires targeted and effective instruments .
The European Union must now continue and focus on real upcoming work , on building dynamic and competitive economies and on establishing a strong global trade system , and especially in the next few weeks , on ensuring a really effective agreement on climate change .
At the time , a peaceful united Europe , a European Parliament , would probably seem like modern as something unthinkable .
However , some aspects of the adopted resolution have not been fully clarified and others have not been sufficiently developed .
But I warn the next Commission - both the President and the Members - that I and others in this House will continue until the end because we need to persuade our producers to meet high standards .
However , the main issue lies in another : if the political nature of the European project is not clarified , we will not be able to tackle our problems .
I fully agree with linking the debate on territorial cohesion to the debate on the future of the European Union &apos;s cohesion policy , given that the reform of this policy should include the conclusions of the debate on territorial cohesion .
If the Member States concerned about budgetary constraints can invest less money in education , training , research and innovation , let us do the same at European level by pooling our resources and therefore by making economies of scale .
In this respect , I ask my fellow Members to adopt an oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution , which is not only to express regret for the situation , but also to urge the Azerbaijani Government to withdraw its decision and review the licences for broadcasting high frequencies ( FM ) for these radio stations .
Let me reiterate that the political commitment made by the Euro Plus Pact complements all the other measures in the Member States &apos; economic performance package : the strengthened Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal surveillance , new macroeconomic surveillance and implementation of the vital Europe 2020 strategy for structural reforms to achieve economic growth .

Such a situation also exists in Bamagarin , Austria .
If they are organised properly , they can indeed change .
There are two aspects that are worth highlighting .

Following the amendment of the Staff Regulations and the Financial Rules of Procedure so that the creation of the European External Action Service is included in these documents , a budget for its proper functioning now needs to be approved .

I personally tabled a review clause ( rendez-vous ) to improve it .

Let this finally indicate the withdrawal of German and French plans to standardise taxation in the EU .
Only person in &apos; in &apos; selling final goods to the consumer pays VAT .
Finally , there is the terrible security situation in the Darfur region and the unilateral desire of the government to organise a referendum on its status on 1 July 2011 .
This system takes much more account of market change and differences of thinking between individual Member States .
Mrs Rapti , I gave you a little more time , as birth always takes a little more time .
In these circumstances , if all the countries in this House are prepared to take action to protect what we call democratic values of the European Union , we must give a formal warning and , as you said , Commissioner , implement European legislation ; to say , alongside the thousands of Italian intellectuals , artists and journalists , that the freedom to inform and the freedom to be informed must be respected unconditionally , as in Italy and throughout the European Union .
They have succeeded , through a long , protracted procedure , in invalidating all the useful proposals for controlling the implementation of ship safety rules or delaying them to indefinitely postpone .

on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group strongly and consistently supports the aspirations of all the countries of the Western Balkans to join the European Union .
However , we are concentrating fully on the Member States and very little on what is behind certain market activities .
In the negotiation process and in defining climate change policies , we will have to give the environmental leadership of the Environment Council more opportunities for external action .
I hope that the Member States and , above all , Italy will transpose this legislation as quickly as possible .
If you wish to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure , you will have this opportunity at the end of the debate .
The data transferred must be used only within a clearly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country .
The next item is the report by Mr Karim , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
I therefore consider the conclusions of the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation - according to which the interests of the outermost regions also need to be examined - for a very pertinent contribution to the fact that Parliament should give assent to these agreements if the Commission and the Council : at the earliest opportunity are presenting Parliament with an impact assessment on the effects of the agreements on banana-producing developing countries , and the outermost regions ; they are taking specific initiatives to strengthen the trade position of banana producers and take measures to finance ACP banana-producing banana-producing countries .
To achieve this objective , the most important thing is the desire of developed countries to open up their markets to developing countries , such as India .
I am very grateful that Mr David and the other colleagues have succeeded in preparing this package , which has received the support of the majority of the members of the committee .
There must be one target for 2020 : every young person must have a job .
Differences in development and increasing inequality in the distribution of opportunities and resources in geographical , social and malaise areas , growing climate change ( for which people are partly responsible ) and the associated increase in natural disasters , increased environmental pollution , unbalanced Antrogenic tensions concentrated in large urban areas and uneven growth of the population in certain areas of land , have contributed to the major humanitarian conditions that contribute to the repair and to the main human dignity of their daily lives .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my gratitude at this early stage to all my fellow Members for working together on this issue , which has enabled all the political groups in Parliament to reach a common position that has made it possible to submit an oral question and to draw up a resolution accompanying the Voluntary Partnership Agreements Agreements .

Schools of sexual and reproductive rights education programmes are also of paramount importance in preventing HIV / AIDS .
Ukraine must act decisively on both fronts , however difficult this may seem at present .
It is extremely important to raise patients &apos; awareness of prescription medicines in order to prevent over-consumption of medicinal products resulting from commercial considerations .
Ukraine is a European country and shares all the cultural values of Europe .
This is why , in our opinion , this law completely contravenes European values described in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
Setting up a common legal framework is absolutely essential in order to facilitate and speed up the development of such infrastructures .
The President answered that these questions are of an internal nature , and the European Union cannot interfere with internal issues .
The European Union must adopt a stronger position on this case .
A potential deficit in the fund is a problem for the fund and its members , not the European taxpayer .
The reason why the Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal is that this premium is only paid in Denmark , Sweden and Slovenia , where , as we know , the bullfighting is not organised .
I am going to comment on a statement by Mrs Doyle here .
All of this requires conviction , time and , above all , political courage that we do not have .
In the proposal made by the Commission ten days ago , the measure becomes optional : in other words , instead of contributing to the single market , it is actually taken away from it .
I believe that for these two reasons , we need to be very careful not about where the money comes from , but about where it goes .
Above all , we must give credit to Vice-President Tajani for the very strong impetus in drawing up the new European tourism policy enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon , through the communication adopted in June last year , and the related implementation plan presented a few weeks ago .
I also support greater budgetary support , whether it is common or whether it is for a particular sector , as well as for fewer projects , where macro-economic and management criteria allow this .
Finally , I would like to say that it was 200 years ago that Darvan had published its book of origin for species .
I believe that , with the Swedish Presidency &apos;s insistence , we will achieve success at the Copenhagen Summit .
However , I believe that the measures already taken regarding the identification of sheep are really good in general .
Mrs Lulling , I have just been told that a debate on rosé wine was scheduled for in May .
( RO ) Madam President , as has already been mentioned by those who have spoken before me , the European Union has obviously not advanced enough to ensure financial stability in its markets .
We are at least at least not the last doomed baggage left to develop the flag of this missile defence system .
I would like to begin with important information on the 2009 Sakharov Prize .
The main objective of the Commission &apos;s competition policy policy objective is to allow the companies affected to benefit from the safety zone by adopting block exemption regulations intended to ensure proper market surveillance .
Madam President , the Spring Summit must be on energy .
Citizens expect the law to be applied uniformly to all .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that the amendments to the EU-Egypt free trade agreements can contribute to economic and political stability in this key region and consolidate a single area of peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
This report aims to contribute to a new energy action plan under the Europe 2020 strategy .
And the question by Mrs Ţicău &apos;s ?
Europe must commit more to achieving the Millennium Development Goals ; in other words , it must earmark at least 0.7 % of GDP to combating poverty in developing countries by 2015 .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that both reports place particular emphasis on the partnership principle .
It is clearly a contradiction to mention the Copenhagen criteria , to mention another type of legislation , and at the same time - when perhaps there is no interest or , let us say , we are not brave enough - to hide behind the lack of powers for the purpose , imagine , not to make progress in the protection of minorities , because we are , after all , faced with an eternal dilemma .
Many of these irregularities have been detected and / or reported belatedly , jeopardising the protection and proper use of taxpayers &apos; money .
The Swedish Presidency of the European Union and the Commission deserve congratulations on their work in putting the Community Civil Protection Mechanism into practice .
I would like to call on the European Commission to take the necessary measures to increase control , which is an integral part of EU consumer policy .
Free Padania !
We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the draft EU budget for 2011 .
Livestock farmers have no contact with end users , but they are dealing with the processors , who always have the opportunity to import .
Nobody is never entirely satisfied , but I personally see the appointment of the two representatives in a positive light , because a balance has been found between the interests of all : between small and large countries , between men and women and between the various political unionists .
Mr President , modern terrorism is dominated by Islamic terrorism .
All the parties involved can and must learn lessons in order to avoid similar situations in the future .
( PL ) Madam President , we all know that diamonds can be the favours , but they can also be the curse .
This is why the European Parliament resolution focuses the greatest attention on creating new jobs and on combating social isolation .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the aspect we have agreed on and which we have established is that this programme of the harmonisation of frequencies and the coordinated use of spectrum can have dual purpose .
The reason is that wars are still under way in the world ; there are currently 4 million Iraqi refugees and displaced persons , and it is obvious that they are a consequence of the wars to start up with which our countries , too , play a role .
Can I ask you now , Madam President , to write a formal invitation to the Czech Presidency , as well as to the forthcoming Swedish Presidency , to launch a formal dialogue with the European Parliament as soon as possible ?
In the face of this reality , Europe &apos;s voice must sound by asking us to honour the commitments we have taken on Official Development Assistance ; by asking for new sources of additional funding to assist these countries ; by demanding the catches and taxes of emigrants to be relaxed ; by asking for action against the attempts at protectionism and assistance in the Doha Development Round ; and by requesting action against the tax evasion and cancers &apos; tax havens ; and to cancers , as well as to cancers , and to cancel taxes , and to cancers .
Some claim that the marking is cost-related , but many products have already been noted , so the additional costs will be minimal .
There are no indicators indicating that the restrictions contained in the report will influence or limit Member States in relation to passports in any way .
I fully agree with the rapporteur .
I would like to thank the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality and the European Parliament as a whole for all the work done to achieve this success .
Foreign operators do not pay anything to use our roads , but the diesel duty in the UK is almost 23 pensions per litre , which gives an advantage of 15 % to competitors .
Therefore , the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to create an EU Operational Headquarters can precisely meet this objective , complementing the current command structures of NATO in the area of joint humanitarian and military operations .
However , we must not forget about the jobs that will be affected by the decision we are discussing today .
in writing . - The new rules approved today by the European Parliament will indeed raise the level of consumer rights protection throughout Europe .
The human rights movement is originally defined primarily as a movement to win over Stalinism in the country &apos;s public , political and cultural life .
At the same time , I would stress that we have full accountability and that this is taxpayers &apos; money .
Yesterday , we already met the Commission in Madrid .
If we do so , we will help - at the very least - to extend the decent work programme .
I and my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , are deeply concerned about the shortcomings in the content and the way this charter has been drawn up .
The Financial Regulation provides a stable control system and the EEAS remains closely linked to the Commission .
I wanted to replace it in this extremely important debate .
A powerful and very important source for Central and Baltic States would be the use of the emissions generated under the emissions trading system , in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol , thus profiting from the climate resources of these countries .
Thank you .
I supported the rapporteur &apos;s proposals and the approach adopted by the Commission in the &apos; Single Market Act &apos; , as well as the idea that an annual Single Market forum needs to be conducted .
However , like my fellow Members , I find it regrettable that the Council is questioning Parliament &apos;s new power in deciding on long-term management plans .
I voted in favour of this report .
Report : Paolo Costa
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to express my little disappointment at the fact that in four years &apos; time , we have not yet seen a Commission proposal on how we can tighten up animal transport legislation .
The report is the result of a compromise because Objective 1 625 amendments have been tabled and it is divided into a series of key points covering the causes of the crisis , from mortgages to bottlenecks of banks , the lack of European tax harmonisation and the failure to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact .
Irrespective of the difficult situation , these measures will allow permanent cash flow to be maintained to ensure that payments to beneficiaries can be made , as the programmes are implemented .
I firmly believe that the tax authorities of the Member States must cooperate in order to monitor tax fraud .
Shahbaz Bhatti , Minister in the government of Pakistan , Salman Taseer , Governor of the Province of Punjab , or Sabir Jamaldini , coordinator of the Pakistani Human Rights Commission , have , for us , become innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law .
I would like to express myself in a way that reflects the positive regarding the European Union , because , surprisingly , there are also positive things that have happened recently .
This is an important measure which helps families with children and allows them to reduce the unfair tax burden they face .
We must face them with enthusiasm and not with backward thinking .
in writing . - ( LV ) European livestock farmers are currently experiencing difficulties , which we must overcome together to allow the livestock sector to develop and generate sufficient income for farmers .
This is dire and the European Union applies a principle of overtaking control .
Now changes are being proposed to the Treaty which , before it was intended to remain a whole generation , in a simplified process , as EU powers have requested , in order to create a mechanism that they believe is &apos; fully in line with the policies &#91; of the International Monetary Fund &#93; &apos; .
The ability to work as self-employed workers is very important to women , as they can do much to help them to choose a job or to better reconcile work and family life .
It is very important for the EU to act and become a world leader in reducing carbon emissions as we approach the Copenhagen Summit .
It is also important to create opportunities for the participation of women in rebuilding following wars in their countries .
This will enable applicants from all the Member States of the IMF to compete on the basis of their merits , taking into account all relevant aspects .
Without this aid , Ukraine will not be able to continue the integration process in a number of areas of the economy and fulfil other objectives .
To a large extent , as a result of the efforts of the European Parliament , all funds in the European Union will , in fact , respect the same rules .
in writing . - ( HU ) For half a year , the European Union has gone from a long-pledged situation to an almost total lack of unity .
This will save companies whose products have been certified in one country , through the whole certification process in another country .
We are convinced that it is extremely important to work with India to bring a successful conclusion to the negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement that will enable both sides - the European Union and India - to win .
Antibiotic resistance ( debate )
Mr Takkula &apos;s report poses a significant social problem .
Many of the recent events have shown us the importance of consumer confidence , which is partly based on relevant consumer protection laws in the market .
I wonder whether Mrs Ashton could confirm this and also carry out an analysis of the situation .
The Muslim Brotherhood is openly promoting this agenda and attached 20 % of the preferences of the electorate .
Of course , we have the EU 2020 strategy , where sustainability is the planned objective .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that what happened in the Committee of the Regions was a serious and detrimental violation of the rights of an EU Member State .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am surprised by the discussion by those of my fellow Members who , on the one hand , are talking about simplifying the procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises , and when it comes to taking the first step towards micro-entities that are the subject of today &apos;s debate and not businesses on another scale , are once again prepared to say &apos; no &apos; .
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to support the management of such waste to stop being dangerous , and the adoption of regulators who are more demanding and prevent the violation of the directive .
Our aim must be to move fully from renewable energy to 2050 .
We need a full application of existing regulations accordingly , and I believe that your comments on navigation and so on are useful in this debate .
In another place , the strategy complains about the fact that Europe has an ageing population .
I believe that , as Parliament , we must fight for more dynamic solutions when reacting to emerging problems in Europe , while not forgetting to work with more transparency in managing the funds .
It is also completely absurd and unacceptable that Members of the European Parliament , behind closed doors , should ask for information from the Commission on the content of the agreements on which we are to vote .
I would also like to emphasise the positive interaction between public and private actions in stimulating victim compensation and in establishing a five-year period for bringing claims .
I join the rapporteur in her positive assessment of the efforts he has made to consolidate the management of financial and human resources , as well as the improved functionality and effectiveness of the functions for carrying out internal control achieved in 2008 .
We can usually appreciate Russia &apos;s sincerity as regards its commitment to conflict resolution as this , but the fact is that in Transnistria , as in Georgia and in Ukraine , Russia cannot resist from intervening .
I am pleased with the adoption of the report drafted by my colleague , Mr Jáuregui , on the accession of the European Union to the ECHR .
in writing . - Parliament has today voted to change the legal basis for legislation on radioactive contamination of foodstuffs .
I therefore agree that we must ask the Member States to take steps to improve the situation of children left by their parents in their country of origin and to ensure their normal development in terms of education and social life .
The Campania region and , in general , the country of Italy is working on the creation of a waste disposal network , in accordance with European legislation .
Above all , it will make the market safer and more competitive .
I call for the credible intervention of the President of the European Parliament to receive a response on this attack .
In the Europe we dream of , freedom of speech is one of fundamental values .
( DE ) Mr President , in all the countries that are going through the crisis , there have been real problems .
We call on the Council to stop doing so , and also on itself to be courageous .
For this reason , my group and I support this directive because it represents an important step on the part of Parliament ; a step that will have a beneficial impact on the lives of the people of Europe .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Commission &apos;s proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights brings together four existing Community documents into a legislative instrument .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , and especially Mr Sánchez Presedo , on behalf of the socialists and Mrs Bowles , who have worked very successfully with me on the compromise text that is being tabled today as a report on the Commission &apos;s White Paper .
( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , the extent to which this debate refers to the authors of the matter can be seen from the fact that none of them is currently in the Chamber and , therefore , will not hear what Inese Vaidere just said - that Russia &apos;s real visa policy was a weapon that uses not to promote the naturalisation process in Latvia , but to achieve the exact opposite .
However , I believe that the work carried out allows us to be optimistic .
I think the EU should carefully assess this opportunity during the forthcoming dialogue organised by the High Representative .
( DE ) Mr President , this debate reflects unresolved problems in Europe &apos;s economic policy .
Moreover , the Commission &apos;s strategy for controlling research has been designed to create a reasonable degree of security for the legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis for the entire implementation of the framework programme .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
What we are seeing is an attempt to manipulate the European Union &apos;s trade policy - to which , unfortunately , the United Kingdom is bound for the time being - in order to apply silence to a very much Socialist agenda that has been consistently rejected .
It is important for us to give a clear signal that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated .
Broadcasting media are among the most important sources of information available to citizens of the Member States of the European Union and , as such , are an important factor in shaping people &apos;s values and opinions .
No one on this land can understand that .
If some do not want to return to their homes , they can ask for their dark political asylum .
If this is not an obsession with state-sponsored homophobia and criminalisation of the public expression of our homosexuals , what is it ?
It will not just benefit individual entrepreneurs , as the European market will also become more competitive than other major economies such as the United States , China or Japan .
To get rid of , prevent or anticipate everything that can happen in aviation is impossible .
There is also improvement in this area .
In this work , it follows the conclusions of the European Council meeting in March 2010 , which underlines the need to reduce the school dropout rate in Europe and which also set the general target of reducing this share to below 10 % by 2020 .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , every year , thousands of children become victims of trafficking and are abducted even more .
Good governance and EU regional policy (
We must remember that GDP is an indicator of measuring production and does not measure environmental sustainability , for example .
Such cooperation makes life much easier for the rapporteur .
It is therefore politically important that we vote in favour of this text and the sudden stalemate of Mrs Wallis - and also of part of the plenary - given the debates we have had .
This is also supported , and both by a study carried out by the Commission by the Swiss Institute on Compartial Law and the report by Mrs Schaldemose in 2009 adopted by Parliament .
( NL ) I will begin by thanking Mr Bowis for his vigorous and dedicated efforts in the name of public health and patient mobility , and I wish him a speedy recovery .
The problems of European aviation over recent days have demonstrated once again the important role played by passenger and freight transport in the organisation of today &apos;s society .
We have done so , secondly and above all , because you use the attention that would otherwise normally be paid to the victims , in order to create a new effect on immigration &apos;s source : social and legal assistance , automatically providing a card to resident , access to the labour market , simplified access to family and social assistance .
Moreover , they have revealed their opposition to certain policies , such as tax reduction policies , in a communication addressed to several governments .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the package on which we are to vote tomorrow would be impossible without the will of the European Parliament , and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to praise the work carried out .
Unfortunately , however , GDP no longer constitutes a reliable basis for political discussion because it does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration .
I believe that this issue must be addressed by the G20 .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effectiveness of European agencies relating to employment , working conditions and training .
The truth is that the noble cause of human rights all too often falls , while lawyers are millions of unsufferers , defending the false rights of terrorists , criminals and greedy people .
Today , the European Parliament demands that Dawit Isaak and other journalists in prison in Eritrea be released immediately .
Madam President , honourable Members , let me take this opportunity to thank you for the additional EUR 10 million that Parliament approved at the end of 2008 for the European Refugee Fund .
At present , patients are increasingly often looking for information relating to health so that they can participate actively in decisions concerning their health .
They are illusory and disturbed by the possibility of being thrown out of the labour market .
Without paragraph 1 , all this is pointless and paragraph 1 , in which we call for a strong and sustainable CAP with a budget commensurate with ambitious objectives , will also be pointless .
the report by Mr Grech , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on ensuring a single market for consumers and citizens ,
Realistic indicators must be set for increasing employment , especially increasing the employability of young people .
I think there is one good thing here : that we are all interested in research and that we know they are the only hope of Europe and of the Member States .
I would like to say that it was wrong that the Presidency did not strongly condemn the article in the Swedish newspaper .
Measures are needed to curb late payments in commercial transactions in order to safeguard the stability of the European economy , avoiding situations where production structures are experiencing financial difficulties and price increases for financial products , thereby increasing dependency on the banking sector .
It is absurd to promote imports of products that do not even meet the quality criteria that our farmers have to meet .
In conclusion , we are facing huge challenges linked to securing a single position at European level to make a strategic commitment with key external partners and to maintaining our full commitment to multilateral climate action , but we need to draw a number of conclusions from the COP 15 .
It should therefore be built on real problems , asked the right questions and concentrate on concrete measures that will give added value to people &apos;s everyday lives .
Oral questions and written declarations ( tabling ) : see Minutes
Opening of the session
I would like to thank the rapporteur sincerely once again for his very constructive position .
I welcome the amendment tabled by Parliament , which contributes to the protection of bees which , due to pollination , are extremely important for farmers and food stocks .
In this way , we can encourage consumers to choose , in the long term , cleaner vehicles or modes of transport , to use less freight infrastructure or to travel in different hours .
In the area of security , we are concerned about Iran &apos;s attitude and the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan .
I believe it is important to go to the negotiations in order that the best solution to this issue is a solution that includes making a joint commitment by everyone .
We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at low levels .
On the other hand , other countries have decided for reasons that seem to reflect their own narrow interests with regard to candidates , to take advantage of the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of the area and try to leave them out of the area , once again .
I am pleased that agreement has been reached on the text allowing the freezing of the &apos; user or lose it &apos; rule over the summer season .
We must therefore analyse , for example , what has happened in Detroit to try to avoid mistakes , but we must not respond to any post-attack , because this will probably lead to the adoption of measures which , in some cases , will simply not make sense .
At the very least , all mothers of full-time work should be supported for the purposes of additional pension provision .
All further ill-intentioned and unjustified political attacks are unnecessary .
In this respect , Europe &apos;s approach should be &apos; yes &apos; , of course , that we need external supply , security of supply and innovative projects such as Desertec &apos; , but at the same time we must ensure that people , companies , businesses and individual households better control their energy costs - such as price , savings and environmental protection .
For these reasons , the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the proposals requiring an impact assessment and will vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr Sturdy - which I personally have signed - concerning endocrine disruptions and those under which plant protection products can be provided provided with urgency .
It is outrageous that the same hard-working parties should again pay for the mistakes of others .
For some time , Europe has been very heavily involved in the region : EUR 1 billion a year for Afghanistan , EUR 300 million for Pakistan , EUPOL , which is doing invaluable work despite personnel problems , the international monitoring mission , and also , of course , the commitments of individual Member States regarding the ISAF mission .
This is the first thing .
Another necessary measure is India to draw up and implement a number of transparent and clear public procurement regulations which , among other things , make it possible for European companies to access these markets .
Thus , with an appropriate impact assessment and by clarifying the various legal alternatives , and by clearly defining the objectives and funding of European infrastructure , long-term strategic projects to build a stronger EU will be easier to achieve .
Part of this process is the ratification of the new TART treaty , which has not yet been examined by the US Congress .
It is becoming increasingly mobile , and the recent threats analysis indicates that organised crime is involved in increasing cybercrime .
I also believe that , as has already been said , we have clarified which aspects are worthy of criticism , namely group supervision .
I am ready to work together with the President of the European Council , because this partnership will have great significance .
However , the positive thing is that the report provides for the creation of an immigration liaison officers &apos; network which commander into consular services and international organisations and have an obligation to prevent illegal immigration and facilitate the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
Now people can rightly say that the Brandenburg Road has become the door to freedom .
Firstly , the communication notes how to improve good governance in tax matters within the European Union in order to strengthen the arguments against other jurisdictions .
I spoke about the blatant choices at the beginning of my speech , and the Commission knows which routes it wants to take .
However , it is obvious that if the two main parties in the country continue to show tenacity , then this objective will never be achieved .
In my opinion , your input is all the more decisive since the current situation is forcing the Member States to make a difficult choice where I believe it is extremely important to protect research and innovation as an investment in the future , and I can assure you that I will inform the Council about the content of this debate and that it will remain available to you .
We must have the humility to recognise the right to democracy and the sovereignty of the 27 Member States &apos; parliaments .
I also believe that we need to continue the zero tolerance policy in the area of human rights and democratisation and that we need to expect extremely high standards .
( RO ) Mr President , this regulation is a step towards the gradual achievement of the CO2 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles in Europe .
We see that this transport strategy is at the heart of important strategic activities in Europe .
The people threatened to the greatest extent by unethical practices , such as children , teenagers and the elderly , must be subject to special protection .
Despite these reservations , I welcome the announcement of micro-credits open in Poland .
It is up to the Egyptian authorities to take urgent measures to stop torture , investigate all cases of violence against peaceful protestors and put an end to civilian trials .
There are even cases where different national systems exist simultaneously in one country .
The answer , therefore , is to have more democracy , not more far-right politicians , hostility to people and cynical contempt for people .
It is naïve to put hopes on a database covering the whole of the EU , with all its different languages and IT systems , once the failed attempt to build a healthcare database for the UK alone squander billions of GBP .
In October 2010 , the Commission adopted the &apos; Single Market Act &apos; communication to instigate a new boost to the Single Market initiative .
In view of legal certainty and predictability , the EU must today develop an effective and transparent dispute settlement mechanism that is accessible to all investors , including the smallest ( for example , SMEs ) .
This proposal for an EU tax is unconstitutional .
We need a plan B , as has quite rightly been pointed out , and the alternative is the railway system .
I would like to express our thanks to the European Parliament for the additional sum of EUR 3 million in the European Union budget for 2008 for restoring cultural heritage to those affected by the war in the Western Balkans .
Moreover , it is the duty of the Member States to ensure that no return operations are undertaken to violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which obliges the Member States to ensure that no person is returned to their country if he is in danger of persecution or serious attacks after his return .
This will allow you to be more effective than if you introduce opt-out rights and allow the various funds to work separately .
When adopting regulations at EU level , it is absolutely imperative to be aware of the extreme vulnerability of women and children in connection with domestic violence .
I hope that once all the 26 elected parliaments have taken their decision , the people of the executive will not hold the democratic process by refusing to grant their signature .
A 2010 progress report on Iceland .
There are also significant differences in the number of convictions of violence against women in individual Member States .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
For me , the key issue is raising awareness and I believe these reports will help achieve this objective .
The next item is the vote .
It is important to realise that we are in a period of transition from an intergovernmental approach to a Community approach , and I would like to express my satisfaction with the work on justice and home affairs .
We must not forget , however , that efforts for the good of the child are first of all .
Instead of completely excluding micro-entities from the fourth directive , we must clearly define a more relaxed regulatory requirement within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives .
When military action escalates to an extent that jeopardises the security of the international institutions , the situation is extremely serious .
This report contains the following important proposals : improved collection of information at local and regional level ; better information for patients ; increased numbers of nurses specialised in the control of infections ; promotion of education and training of health staff ; and greater emphasis on nosocomial infections .
Ireland has now decided to hold a second referendum .
I welcome the initiative by the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , asking the European Union to formally recognise the genocide carried out by the Nazis and their allies against the Roma population during World War II , because this is a step forward in the fight to protect the rights of the most prevalent ethnic minority in Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , it is not for the first time that our fellow Member , Mr Cohn-Bendit , who has called the President - Prime Minister - a dictator such as Hugo Chávez , does not respect democracy .
The Tobin Tax is an example of a tax on financial transactions that is being proposed .
A large number of Roma all over Europe continue to suffer extreme poverty , discrimination and marginalisation , so it is high time for improvement .
It is the duty of society to guarantee this freedom , not to discriminate against an activity simply because it does not coincide with the normal frameworks of the formal labour market .
In my 30 years of professional experience in the area of accounting and auditing , I have never seen the auditing person giving instructions to an auditor how to do his job .
It is good that Parliament is paying particular attention to the implementation and transposition of the legislation that we are adopting here .
I am thinking of the removal of duties on textiles arriving from Pakistan , which would cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs , both in Lombardy and in the rest of Europe .
Composition of committees : see Minutes
The dramatic changes in European rural areas represent challenges for the population , jobs , services and the environment .
It is therefore vital to develop concrete and coordinated cooperation and , at the same time , adapt it to the new challenges in international relations .
From Copenhagen , I expect balanced commitments , short-term and long-term commitments and those that can be checked along with financial units in the event of non-compliance .
That is why the delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) voted against the proposal and requested that the expenditure on all unjustified losses be borne by stakeholders .
I ask these questions because , while I am pleased with the solidarity measures taken on 11 February , I seriously doubt that we Europeans are in control of the situation .
They will tell them that , at one time , Europe was divided , a great wall was erected at the centre and the people who lived to the east were very poor and did not have democracy and lived under a bad system called communism that kill millions of its own people .
I would remind you that the Polish Parliament has approved the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in April this year , but ratification documents have not yet been signed by the President .
I agree with his assessment of the Commission &apos;s proposal and would like to make a few comments about the importance of such activities .
The next item is the joint debate on :
Most importantly , the negotiations are open and that Parliament is ready for them .
We consider the accusations that can be levelled against them to be unfounded , and I can assure you that we will continue our contacts with the Iranian authorities on all routes possible until we have a satisfactory solution to these issues - namely , the release of the people in question .
In Jobbik , we would like to put an end to the economic monopoly of multinationals and for Europe to return to small farmers and family businesses so that unemployment can be eliminated with their help within the European Community .
In accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Civil Liberties , I voted against the draft decision .
The challenges are as follows : firstly , we need to move forward towards a common migration policy ; secondly , to significantly improve the organisation of legal migration ; thirdly , to improve integration procedures ; in fourth , to fight hard against illegal or illegal immigration ; in the fifth place , we need to develop Frontex further ; at a hundred , to improve the procedures , conventions and agreements with the countries of origin and transit , and to make progress on common asylum policy ; and to a half .
With the Irish &apos; yes &apos; , we know that the Treaty of Lisbon will enter into force ; we are sure it was the last obstacle .
The priority is given to employment , as economic recovery is not possible without any reduction in unemployment .
The European Union must serve as a model both for tightening up the rules and for efforts in solidarity .
There were 1 336 redundancies between 14 June and 14 October 2010 , while other 1 498 redundancies were made before and after the period in question .
The aim is to reach a final version and report on the outcome of the negotiations at the June Council .
The 2008 financial crisis has clearly demonstrated the need for the European supervisory bodies to coordinate the regulation and supervision of the financial sector in the European Union .
For example , we remember the research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme , especially those that took place with the involvement of the Israeli agro-space industry , which produced countless aircraft used in the attack on the Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009 , causing the deaths of dozens of people .
( LT ) Thank you , Minister , for your efforts to combat poverty from the position of a presiding country .
I share the view that without a global agreement , all our efforts will lead to nothing .
I would emphasise one paragraph in the Commission &apos;s draft statement , which applies to the proposal .
The three reports maintain the spirit and the forward-looking ideas that characterise Professor Mario Monti &apos;s new strategy for the Single Market , they manage to represent the unity of objectives for revitalising the single European market through 50 measures that were later rebuilt and synthesised , or indicated by Parliament in 14 priorities .
Governments in the Gulf of Gulf are responding differently : significant financial packages to ease the most pressing and social needs , to announcement of political reforms , to renounce certain legislative powers to the electoral authorities or to open up to comprehensive and inclusive talks at national level .
As regards Mr Ziobro &apos;s argument , there is no risk that the Strasbourg Court will interfere with the Union &apos;s jurisdiction .
I will put all these issues on the table again during the negotiations on the reform of the POSEI programme .
in writing . - I would like to reiterate the admiration expressed during the debate for the courage of the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples in expressing their discontent and disappointment with their respective regimes .
So I simply do not understand why we cannot work on the same agenda from this point of view .
The European Union has introduced legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers and employees affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to help their reintegration into the labour market .
The large-scale nature of the final text and the guarantees it gives on consumer rights talk about its exclusive skills in the negotiations .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to introduce a requirement for EU Member States to report back each year to the Commission on the activities of their export credit agencies in terms of risk calculation and of off-balancing instruments and the introduction of compulsory notification of social and environmental risk calculations .
Mrs Ronzulli , please sit down and stop talking .
This is an important fact , which shows Parliament &apos;s will and ability to propose as a candidate to play a central role in the CFSP / CSDP on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon .
Therefore , in general , I support this report , provided that only Member States retain a leading role in the management , purpose and protection of wilderness .
First of all , after this long journey for several months , it will take Parliament &apos;s wish to see that the service exists , to reflect the needs of the electorate you represent , and to serve these constituents .
The item is closed .
This and other topics can be discussed at the summit .
Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity must not be discussed .
So , as you can see , we are almost at the same level .
This is why the debate is important to remind you that , this year in 2009 , the Commission made a commitment to present to Parliament a communication on the assessment of possible threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information on a European scale and to draw attention to the importance of drawing up a draft directive which guarantees pluralism of information , in view of new technologies and , in particular , regarding television .
The effective implementation of the directive in question and compensation for the shortcomings noted in the transposition and implementation of the earlier directives will complement the existing protection of EU citizens against discrimination .
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report , as it highlights the importance of European political parties as necessary as participants in the EU &apos;s political life , specific proposals are proposed with a view to creating a secure and transparent regulatory environment for the functioning and funding of European political parties .
Therefore , if we want to achieve the objectives that are set here this weekly , we need an ambitious budget , and this does not mean less , but more money in the future .
Yanukovich won the elections and became president in a democratic manner , albeit with a small prejudice .
At a time when the impact of the recession and the sovereign debt crisis are being felt strongly , we need strong economic governance at EU level .
The joint debate is closed .
The rapporteur sees all the conditions for abolishing border checks with Bulgaria and Romania , but wants the European Parliament to be kept regularly informed of the additional measures to be taken at the border with Bulgaria - Greece - Turkey , which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration .
I am pleased to note that the regulation on the rights of passengers travelling by air transport has proven to be essential for securing a safety net to ensure that passengers do not suffer the main blow of the financial consequences of disruption and that they are not left in dire straits due to chaos .
As in 2004 , the Presidency of the Council will be invited to elect a candidate for this important position of the main European parliamentary group , and then our Parliament will be expected to give its opinion on this choice on 15 July , which will constitute one of the first important political actions of the new parliamentary term .
We must ask all political forces to work to put an end to the crisis , as the alternative is Albania &apos;s isolation and its European prospects under threat .
I agreed with this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
I also urge that we need to demand the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba , as well as anywhere in the world , but I want to warn that action should not be taken that have already failed , but did not contribute to Cuba &apos;s progress along the path to democracy and freedom , such as embargo and blockade .
For the sake of the citizens of Sri Lanka , I want the expression &apos; war &apos; to be an institution I have heard time and again to finally remain in the past .
Public opinion is particularly sensitive and is totally opposed to unnecessary , difficult practices .
Secondly , if we are serious about achieving the 95 % target by 2050 , then we need to include in the roadmap at least 30 % by 2020 .
Overall , industry and , above all , investors &apos; groups agree that there needs to be such an instrument , over the three years in which the DFID applies , market participants fail to unite and provide a European consolidated information system .
We must also enable regulators to ensure that these rights are duly granted .
Like Mr Tajani , I , too , would like warmly to express my gratitude for the work carried out by Mr Barrot , which was very important , and also for the good will shown by the French Presidency .
The European Parliament has orphan without her presence , but the Swedish Presidency has certainly benefited from this .
Europe must ensure that we are much more effective with regard to energy consumption .
Its purpose is to purchase goods and services with the best price / quality ratio .
We Swedish Social Democrats are nonetheless pleased that you have listened in the end to our demands and those of this House to include more things on women &apos;s rights and children in the programme .
Obviously , various kinds of changes are under way in the Member States .
The exact opposite of what these organisations intended to achieve .
( FR ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s resolution shows that , in this area as in so many others , our institution has absolutely no rights to judgment on the dogmas that persecute us .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Van Rompuy , ladies and gentlemen , I see two main problems with the proposed amendment to Article 136 : an institutional and one political one .
So this is a step in the right direction .
Nevertheless , I do not agree with linking the fight against HIV to sensitive issues such as abortion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to the 2007 annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy , I would like to highlight some important issues from the perspective of the Committee on Budgets .
Finally , the nature of the report is also revealed by the lack of any reference to antidemocratic decisions and the prosecution of citizens , such as the ban on Communist parties and other organisations and the imprisonment of Communists and other activists in the EU Member States in Central Europe and the Baltic States .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon .
We must put a stop to free trade policies , we must put a stop to the free movement of capital , we must promote food sovereignty , we must also show water and energy for global public goods , and we must combat social and economic inequalities .
firstly , that the future of agriculture in the Community must be guaranteed even after 2013 ;
In my opinion , the question arises here as to whether this already concerns funding existing cohesion or new projects .
That is why we have to say that we stand by these people after President Mubarak &apos;s speech today , after the regime has left its persecutors and once he cleared the way for violence .
Today , I would like to thank the chairs of Mr Grel and Mr Pörttering and the Committee on Petitions in Parliament for their support in the struggle of Mayel for justice .
I therefore voted against the report .
For the European Union and Portugal , I see more benefits than losses given the compulsory objective .
To win as much as a man for a calendar year , a woman must work by the end of February next year , or a total of 418 days .
For a decade , they have been systematically discriminated against and threatened by assimilation and death , and their identity is in danger .
This report is on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I , too , would like to thank the Commissioner for coming here this evening to make further explanations about the powers he wants .
The group has ignored the main issue of reorganising the international monetary system .
Human rights must be central to their concerns .
As a result , these companies will no longer be tempted to engage in illegal activities .
( CS ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the EU &apos;s common visa policy is now facing a major challenge in the form of the visa requirements imposed for the last 10 months by Canada for the citizens of the Czech Republic .
EMA plays a vital role as the preferred source of objective information .
As a result of yesterday &apos;s meeting between President Buzek and Mr Zapatero , a proposal was tabled to amend today &apos;s vote , and agreement was reached on the immediate commencement of dialogue at the highest institutional level on certain procedural aspects relating to the Council &apos;s discharge .
Subject : Rail motorway in the Alps
If we were in the Rome Rome , a Senator dressed in his throes , we would certainly have done and said to Mr Trichet : &apos; Quoustanm abutere , Tricte , Trichete , patinostra ? &apos; - until when , Mr Trichet , will abuse our patience ?
Finally , Mr President , if you will allow me to dispel any doubt that may exist , I would like to suggest that a European Parliament committee be established to investigate this matter .
The services insections have been deliberately removed from public procurement directives in order to ensure greater flexibility in these areas and to take into account cultural differences .
I agree with some of the other ideas expressed , but I believe that Article 4 needs to be made a success and comprehensible .
I believe that this network could be very useful , but it does not work effectively at the moment and does not fully exploit its potential .
It is , of course , true that EPAs are different from the conventions of Lomé and Cotonou , which have embodied the Union &apos;s relations with the ACP for 30 years , but the unilateral preferences that characterise these conventions have become vulnerable to criticism in the WTO from other developing countries .
However , while we fully support the integration of Roma within the European Union , we have serious concerns about the European Union &apos;s involvement in issues which , in our opinion , are the prerogatives of individual nation states , such as access to health , education , employment and housing .
It is essential to prioritise food security , agriculture , infrastructures , capacity building and , in particular , economic growth and access to technologies , as well as human and social development in respect of the LDCs .
This cannot continue .
The ultimate aim is to achieve better implementation of EU law and thus , congratulate animals and decent living conditions for the animals concerned .
What measures will you take to encourage rich countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis ?
We also need best practice , because Slovenia , for example , is following vehicles through its territory .
It is also important for decisions not only to benefit our fellow citizens today and tomorrow , but also to guarantee the future of our children .
If we want to avoid suspension , we need to maintain the level of exploitation of 30 % .
In this respect , we have a number of problems to resolve urgently .
Cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing productivity disparities caused by the crisis , but also to increasing productivity .
This is a very important issue for all EU citizens , and the way in which the Commission and Parliament view it will be very important for taking responsibility and transparency .
To sum up , let me stress that all the non-standard measures that we have adopted during the period of severe financial stress are temporary in nature and are designed for their withdrawal .
This report is shocking because of what it reveals about the behaviour of this House .
a strict organisation of projects , an efficient use of resources and clarity regarding their duration ;
At present , they do not have access to such information and they are at risk , as you yourself said .
I would also like to state in advance that I support all Turkey &apos;s efforts and attempts towards democratisation .
In this Commission proposal , the concept of micro-enterprises has been broadened and they are defined as enterprises which , by the date of concluding the balance sheet , do not exceed the threshold of two of the following three indicators : a total balance sheet value for EUR 500 000 , a turnover of EUR 1 000 and a medium-sized number of employees over the financial year :
However , we must fulfil our commitment to climate change : everyone recognises that we are the world leader in this area .
rapporteur . - Madam President , you have been slightly surprised to me because I have not seen the completely changed agenda today , but I am very grateful for the opportunity to address Parliament on an extremely important issue for the financial services sector , i.e. insurance and over-insurers , on what we have done on the Solvency II report and on how we have ultimately presented it to Parliament , for a specific basis , in which we will be able to do in my opinion , to regulate this very specific activity in the European Union .
It is therefore absolutely essential to move to 30 % and I will conclude by joining the words of Barack Obama , when he said that we could leave jobs to the future of our competitors or could take advantage of the opportunity of the century , as they have already begun to do .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to make four comments .
That is why I and a number of other Members have also invited an expert who has investigated the trading of organs and the warning of people in China for organs for transplants , to come and speak with us tomorrow .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , thank you for your constructive and comprehensive report and wish you every success to your Presidency !
These initiatives , supported by European Commission funds , enable us to work specifically on certain projects and programmes , combining the good aspects of each institution and , as such , represent an excellent test in which to force our joint work in the future .
- ( SK ) Once again we are facing a problem of respect for the rights of an ethnic minority in Slovakia , and that is the fault of the Minister for Education , who is a member of the extremely nationalistic ruling party .
In view of the necessary guarantees such as the possibility for European citizens to make an administrative complaint and to be treated as US citizens and the timing of the data to be stored , cooperation between Europe and the United States is , in this case , due to the negative impact of globalisation .
The EIB can and must have an important role to play in the management of recent events in the Mediterranean .
I therefore support the call for a study into the margins in the production and distribution chain .
However , if you always put the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle first - I am ready to discuss this with you - then it is the Member States that cause congestion because they do not provide adequate infrastructure .
The first concerns credit to student mobility .
However , what is important is that we realise - although the problem predominantly affects the southern borders of Europe - that we have an opportunity here to strengthen citizens &apos; attachment to the idea of Europe , their sense of belonging , which is a valuable contribution to this .
Today , Europe has lost its strength despite the fact that it has a higher percentage of educated people than more successful countries such as China or India .
We therefore need a greater and better Europe : a more united and ambitious Europe .
I am convinced that they are a step in the right direction .
The Greek Communist Party does not agree with and voted against the amendments to adapt the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to make this point : it is very surprising that , while Albania &apos;s growth indicators are constantly rising , with Albania rising in 2010 in the middle of global economic instability , it is estimated that more than 2 % , which is expected to reach 3 % in 2011 , social tensions , rather than dry , is deteriorating .
Human trafficking is still a serious problem within the European Union .
Then there are other issues that I would also like to highlight , repeating what Mr Paris said .
In Southern Sudan , the EU must make a significant contribution to stabilising , developing and building institutional capacity .
As you said , the thirteenth amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution is to be implemented , which guarantees the decentralisation of regional governance by the people who live there and , in this respect , the European Union can provide valuable support .
Of course , let me repeat , there are differences of opinion between the Commission and the Council , and also among certain Members in terms of water transport , and there are also some that would prefer separate legislation on river and maritime transport .
I am in favour of the way in which the proposal is justified , namely the need to define a coherent and comprehensive framework for the development of investments in energy infrastructure in the Union , which will allow the Commission to monitor the state of play of development of planned investment projects in the energy sector .
The events were encouraging : in 1995 , a global consensus was reached whereby women and men are equal from all perspectives , including political , economic , legal and social points of view .
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that they properly implement the rule of law and democracy and ensure continuous reduction in the level of corruption in Serbia , and that those officials who abuse their position are severely punished .
In short , small are the chances of the Europe that we are fighting for - a characteristic of justice and social progress , economic and social cohesion , cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights and promoting peace - being implemented with the guidelines proposed by this Commission .
From the point of view of democracy and legitimacy , it is important that we report to our citizens what the EU does .
We Germans will not be fair about our national unity if we do not regard it as a contribution to the unity of Europe as a result of the historical events I have highlighted here .
To put it plainly , the same person will be doing the job of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner .
As I said on a previous occasion in this Chamber , I stand before you as a man keen Europe of nations cooperating with each other .
- Report : Elles
In the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats abstained from voting .
Moreover , the compulsory nature of the register for all lobbyists who want constant access to Parliament and the Commission is an important step in increasing transparency in relations between these organisations and European institutions .
However , if we adopt everything at first reading , Parliament is deprived of its own rights .
This is a very important step which guarantees more effective implementation of the fundamental rights of EU citizens .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the vote on Mr Kirilov &apos;s report will take place over the next few weeks , and I welcome this because it is indispensable .
Personally , I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation , because most vans are bought up by businesses , small and large , which are already well aware of the need for savings and efficiency of fuel .
I propose that the consolidated accounts be examined .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to make a general comment and then to put two or three questions , depending on how much time you will give me .
We must not forget that our neighbours in the European Union will be countries such as Iraq , Iran and Syria .
In my opinion , we must finally realise that we cannot talk about economic policy without constantly bearing in mind the employment parameter .
What would the EU expect ?
We must not forget that with every action we have a responsibility to our constituents , who are living in difficulties today .
However , for the same reason , export credit agencies can lead to significant distortions in trade if their financial transactions are not subject to common rules .
I believe that there can only be good governance in the Single Market if there is good and up-to-date information about the way it works .
in writing . - ( ET ) In the current era of global economic crisis ( i.e. the economic recession and rising unemployment ) , in practice , the EU &apos;s labour market will be reduced , which will further increase the number of people living in poverty and expropriation in Europe .
Of course , we already had a flag , a anthem , but they started to build a new state .
These things are covered to some extent by corporate social responsibility , but they cannot be applied without a national framework .
This is a real compromise .
In addition , appropriate operational assistance must be guaranteed in the event of an accident which will provide passengers with the services and the things they need most .
The Council adopts this joint text ; the President of the European Parliament is now to declare the budget finally adopted .
We must support the creation of private funding mechanisms and the adoption of more frequent public and legal initiatives to strengthen the European resettlement programme .
However , our aim is also to put an end to misleading advertising on the Internet , which urges people to buy products that not only treat but may also be detrimental to patients .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to table an oral amendment to the amendment in question to delete two places from him , namely the words &apos; Colombian army &apos; and &apos; Colombia &apos; .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination of the Roma in Europe .
Madam President , once again , I think this is one of the reports that many people can welcome .
Once again , we need to draw attention to the excessive delays between the occurrence of the disaster , the decision to mobilise the EUSF and the actual delivery of EU support to the Member States and regions affected .
We must have legal evidence and we have therefore asked the French Government to provide us with a dossier on these individuals .
Europe cannot simply be a collection of 27 national interest .
Meanwhile , Mr Reinfeldt will present the report for the last six months of the European Council &apos;s activities .
The unattractive side of the austerity measures , which will leave those working in the public sector out of work , must go in a positive direction with regard to the emerging companies on the market , which will benefit from the advantages of the entrepreneurial spirit by reducing the initial costs of setting up businesses so that they create a private sector that is needed to get our countries out of the difficulties we are now experiencing .
The two entities have failed to develop a common vision , with the result that progress has stopped .
Will this ultimately be a free trade agreement beneficial to the world as a whole and to the division of economic power between Europe and India - as they are today - or will it be appropriate in 10 or 15 years &apos; time ?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy programme are to provide broadband access throughout the European Union by 2013 and rapid Internet connections by 2020 .
Moldova &apos;s economic crisis is not just a consequence of the global crisis , but is mainly due to the lack of immediate action that was needed when this crisis occurred in the Republic of Moldova .
European workers and poor in Europe must mobilise to combat disastrous policies and to have a truly democratic and socialist Europe , which means opposing the policy of the new EU Commission .
The European Parliament defends its prerogatives as enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
Animal welfare requirements are formally included in the Treaty establishing the European Union and must be taken into account when determining policies in sectors such as the internal market .
It is mostly expressed at the level of the regions and their cultural heritage and is an asset to be taken into account and highlighted in the context of regional development policy .
I think that we should now focus our efforts on precisely this .
You will need all your ability to convince you of your ability to create a new impetus in the European Union &apos;s international trade policy .
In fact , this reservation is a reporting method to be used in the event of unforeseen circumstances within the current financial year .
Let us observe a minute &apos;s silence in memory of our Tunisian friends .
Many mistakes and one accusation of the defendants : the euro .
Given the initiatives described , I believe that there is a solid basis on which we can improve our fisheries and aquaculture sectors through innovative research under the framework programme .
We are having this debate in a rather technocratic way .
That is why I congratulate Mr Millán Mon for his splendid report , which came at such an appropriate time to strengthen relations between the two continents .
For this reason , EU legislation is required to be significantly simplified .
Unfortunately , important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected and , as a result , initiatives would not be able to be signed by people residing within the territory of the EU who are not nationals of a Member State , thereby preventing the equal involvement of persons residing irrespective of nationality , nor would there be a guarantee that signatures would be in line with the individual identification nominations .
I call for the creation of an independent commission composed of local and international law experts to carry out investigations and prosecutions of the violence that followed the elections in December 2007 .
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West is , to a large extent , dependent on what has been achieved in Afghanistan .
All of this goes too far and must be stopped .
The development of guidelines for public and private organisations and the creation of a training and mobility scheme on how to implement multi-level governance policies will constitute effective measures for improving regional policy .
I hope that our Spanish and Italian colleagues will join it , but we can no longer let the issue wait because the whole world has strived for the innovation market .
Furthermore , I believe that we have an obligation to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies , starting with the next reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , adequately meet these requirements .
Mr President , the negotiations for a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam under way must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties .
Without prejudice over the adoption of some important measures proposed in this report , I would like to draw your attention to an essential element of the problem .
However , this method will not put the economy and jobs at risk of bureaucracy , unfair competition or unforeseen price fluctuations .
It will not have an adverse impact on the stocks of Atlantic cod , as at present , the fishing of Atlantic cod is insignificant .
The proposed sanctions are proportionate and necessary , and we hope that they will discourage unfair commercial practices that apply by many commercial operators .
In my opinion , this criterion is unsound and discriminatory because , as is the case in Portugal , the vast majority of these people live in temporary building in rural areas .
This is a measurement of poverty that is taking place in an absolute and purely financial terms , and where the differences between the 27 Member States are not taken into account ; the reasoning in its favour can be summarised in one , simple solvency .
Therefore , both Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) resources and new funding will be required .
The environmental audit with regard to the work of the draft has had a positive outcome , and this has been confirmed .
In my opinion , the new proposed cofinancing rate of 75 % is too high .
I would like to clarify two things , ladies and gentlemen .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Commissioner for having devoted his attention to the problem of Tunisia .
The rapporteur is most concerned about the fact that the citizens are not informed of the rights he would give them .
While , on the one hand , the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice within the European Union is very important for all of us , and certainly it is an example of the European democratic model we are building , and while many of us believe that Europol is an instrument that can be adapted , we all , however , attach great importance to the fact that pooling resources - in particular human resources , but also technically , to the fight against organised crime , and to European citizens &apos; rights , should be fully monitored : we should be at the same time , protected and strictly controlled .
It is therefore essential to adopt measures that could strengthen the guarantees that IAs will be transparent and independent , as this will help to maximise the role of this instrument in aid of decision making and as a guarantee of the quality and relevance of the activities of EU institutions .
My second point is that the strategy must strengthen the internal cohesion of the European Union , in other words , its convergence .
This is not the direction that I would add , in which the Commission is moving , as its proposal is aimed at by means of the regulation adopted by Parliament , reforming the current system of agencies that are private companies , and at consistently promoting transparency requirements in order to avoid conflicts of interest and integrity in their ratings .
Furthermore , it calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of creating a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation .
Even before the crisis we are facing today , the Member States of the European Union were already facing social problems resulting from weak economic growth , the complex demographic situation and the difficult life in an increasingly globalised world economy .
However , there are motives that give rise to some concerns about the danger of weakening the enthusiasm of Moldova &apos;s citizens .
We have always taken a firm stand in the defence of the autonomous rights of the people of Tibet , which does not mean an automatic right to self-determination or independence .
Although a new directive will appear soon in the world , I voted together with the other Members in favour of a resolution which sets the course to follow Parliament on this issue .
It is therefore necessary to establish a monitoring and verification system for medicines that provides patients with reliable information .
They deserve to fight for them , and I intend to do exactly that .
However , these costs will allow some exceptions , provided that the Member State that has requested them has a good reason to do so .
This framework decision should not lead to unnecessary red tape where there are more suitable opportunities for the problems involved .
The Bank has not understood that a huge crisis is being experienced , nor has it been easy to do with its regulations , which are far from perfect .
However , as a serious organisation , the European Union must be better prepared for such situations and , in particular , it should be prepared to react effectively in urgent cases .
- Report : Kaczmarek
We must therefore support its inclusion only if these measures are ineffective .
I have made a commitment to inform the European institutions about this civil protest .
The European Union and industrialised countries must set themselves the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 % and 40 % by 2020 , and aim in the long term to reduce emissions by 80 % by 2050 , compared with 1990 levels .
Report : Maria do Céu Patrão Neves
I would like to focus in particular on two outstanding issues that have been raised several times during the debate .
First of all , on behalf of the Council , I would like to express my gratitude and gratitude to the European Parliament for its cooperation and for the spirit of compromise that has enabled us to reach agreement in the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of passengers in bus and coach transport in the EU , in particular , with regard to disabled people and passengers with reduced mobility .
One of the reasons for this is our fragmentary defence equipment market .
Just at the start of this period , the subject of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy was an important issue .
The creation of the EEAS will require various decisions , including perhaps modifications to the financial regulation and the Staff Regulations , for which a proposal from the Commission is required and adoption by means of codecision .
We fully support the development of civil capacity in order to establish a good balance between resources .
in writing . - The situation in the whole of North Africa is indeed dangerous , but at the same time fills hopes .
Coordination requires continuous improvement and responsibility from Member States in this area should certainly be increased .
With its very convincing vote , the people of Ireland are giving us the spirit and the strength to move forward and build a strong and , above all , federal Europe .
While environmental protection and the protection of public health go hand in hand , I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers .
It is a major obscure that we have to resolve together .
We should work together with the main countries of consumer , such as the USA , China , Russia and Japan , to solve this problem and establish a global alert system and a register of illegal logging and problematic countries , which include an interpol , a competent body of the United Nations , and benefit from the latest satellite technology systems .
Of course , we cannot allow short-term support for industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness .
I would like to say that this is a report based on the principle of subsidiarity .
Due to the consequences of the current economic and social crisis , the fight against unemployment and social exclusion has drawn the attention of the European public and the European institutions .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to emphasise that this issue is too important for us to continue to maintain the deception that the whole of Europe is experiencing .
As has been mentioned , we did not , of course , know the names of the candidates and there were not women among them , even though , in order to be correct with Commissioner Barnier , he provided an appropriate explanation of this .
We note with regret the percentage of the &apos; no &apos; to the European elections and you vote &apos; no &apos; to referendums .
We will have to ask what has happened and we will inform you , Mr Coelho .
( PL ) Mr President , horizontal agreements cover a wide range of regulations , and supervision of legal regulations , whether it is targeted or not , can lead to the elimination of competition .
We also need a common European asylum system that is more effective and more protective .
That concludes Question Time .
I am also aware that you are ready to participate in a form of police cooperation that respects human rights and adheres to the values of the European Union .
It describes the same horror in its German picture of our Germanist , the collapse to the land from the Silk Roor Silk Lador decades ago .
In this context , speculators are also trying to speculate against a bad economic situation and sometimes further aggravate it .
Mr Bové is quite right and Mr Fajmon is also right in depth ...
We must promote not only competitiveness , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution , guaranteeing diversity in agriculture .
Mr Rapkay &apos;s report amending the Staff Regulations in the context of the creation of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) is a very important document along the path of building the Union &apos;s external policy .
We therefore believe , by raising this issue again at first reading , that initial costs are in line with this priority and we agree with the rapporteur , who has placed emphasis on the issues of multilingualism and buildings , which have always been our top priority , but from the point of view of regulations .
A few weeks ago , I had the honour of leading a delegation from Parliament &apos;s Committee on International Trade attending the Seventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) in Geneva .
With this in mind , Europe will be able to move forward with a high voice .
I ask the Member States to offer names , including women .
Firstly , it is essential to maintain the geographical divide with regard to financial assistance from the European Union budget for Mediterranean countries and the countries in Eastern Europe , in accordance with the provisions of the financial perspective for the 2007g 2013 period , but also to continue to lend support to these countries in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) .
We believe that Kosovo is an exceptional case and we would like to emphasise that it is not recognised by Spain or by four other Member States .
This is a sufficient reason not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU summit in response to the appeals of the Belarusian opposition .
This approach is very important to highlight the current elements of humanity and comprehensiveness of our policy , even if it affects the internal market .
Mr President , I , too , would like to add my voice to what Mrs Kadenbach said about children and to the speeches by my fellow Members about the rights of passengers with disabilities , the question of fire safety in the hotels and , in particular , the issue of the use of fires dispersions in all hotels in the EU , and about the need to accommodate them with future needs .
I also wanted to put a question about gender balance in the Commission , and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment .
It is clear from the report that the Member States alone are competent in defence and national security matters , which we believe is important to emphasise .
Likewise , the Member States , which were most concerned about asset stripping and secret takeovers , were those with lower threshold for private equity and with no differentiation contracts .
I would also like to thank my colleague , Mr Lehne , for his approach .
In other words , the Copenhagen Accord has a reference to the level of ambition needed to tackle climate change for the post-2012 agreement , lays the foundation for the financial package and an invitation is made to serious commitments to reduce emissions .
The PDN-Malaria , malaria and tuberculosis still take four million lives a year .
Rather , from the point of view of trade , I would ask the Commissioner for an assurance that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) will not be used to obstruct the sale of medicinal products at more competitive prices ; safe , generic medicinal products that do not violate copyright and whose only crime is that they are produced in new developing countries , such as India and Brazil , and that they can affect Western pharmaceutical industry .
After all , Members have the right to say what they think .
This is unacceptable .
We want to be involved .
We will therefore have to find the right degree of financial and technological compensation .
This is also an area in which we can take stronger measures as part of competition and consumer policy .
It is also revealing that these politicians want to accept the result of the second referendum , although they did not actually accept the result of the first referendum .
As co-author of the motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan , I would like to express my thanks to the Members who voted in favour of this document today .
I will conclude , Mr President , Minister , with a proposal to future generations .
It is extremely important that we define clear rules and objectives for the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) so that we can achieve sustainable consolidation of the internal market and improve the quality of the environment in the European Union , as well as utilise strategic raw materials .
The Heads of State or Government have also stressed that nuclear safety should not be restricted to the territory of the European Union , and that we will ask our neighbours to carry out these stress tests .
A very clear distinction must be maintained between the powers of military and humanitarian organisations , as well as a dialogue between military and humanitarian organisations , with a view to promoting mutual understanding .
The Commission continues to work on a more systematic assessment of the quality of the development of public finances , including the budgetary aspects based on implementation .
This will be a priority for me as Trade Commissioner .
The Commission can therefore table amending or new proposals depending on the situation .
From now on , the United States must establish clear and transparent visa waiver criteria in certain Member States .
However , the question of funding remains open .
To the rest of the House , we need constructive criticism of Turkey ; we ourselves are virtually critical .
Studies have revealed that profits from human trafficking exceed those of trafficking and the drugs trade .
Families in my part of the world feel completely abandoned and genuinely offended by the fact that they are allowed the idea that they do not know what they do and that they should be told exactly what they do .
No .
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution ; taking into account the negative impact of the liberalisation of markets on the local economy , it underlines the strategic importance of reasonable tariff protection .
Overall , I am voting in favour of the proposals in this report aimed at restoring the European economy through greater financial support for projects in the field of energy .
With this in mind , the report on the European Refugee Fund calling for the resettlement of refugees in the EU is even more incomprehensible .
This preliminary assessment could increase .
Economists use mathematical models to highlight the value of domestic work .
Only when we are fully informed of such cases will we be able to talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law .
Once again , absolutely not .
It is imperative , particularly in the run-up to the Copenhagen conference , that the EU and other international actors formulate their policies on international trade , climate change , humanitarian aid and development .
I would like to mention the speech made by Mr Rehn , whom I personally respect , that Nigeria is a very poor country : it is not true , Nigeria is a very wealthy country , but it is suffering from a corrupt and incapable class that robs the resources of the country , leaving millions of poor ones .
Finally , Mr Mölzer , not being so pessimistic , is what I want to tell you .
I therefore call on the Council to state its position immediately on Parliament &apos;s new proposal so that the ACP countries can take advantage of the measures announced for 2010 and ask the Commission to ensure that social and environmental requirements are reciprocally respected by producers and non-ACP exporters .
This requires the Commission - as the coordinator of the energy community - to address Ukraine rigorously and to remind it of its obligations in terms of security of supply for Europe .
Of course , we deplore the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes , irrespective of the abuses that have taken place in Europe or former European colonies , for example .
The main objective of the regulation should be to implement a new common culture of control and responsibility , not to impose a bureaucratic and costly process for verifying each product .
Member of the Commission . - The EU &apos;s current competition policy on vertical agreements significantly supports Internet sales , and I am sure you know that , Mr President .
On the other hand , the report contains clear recommendations on the second and third error , and they are all pointing in the right direction .
With regard to transport , more needs to be done to stimulate car manufacturers to develop more efficient vehicles .
The financial situation in some euro area countries that we are examining today clearly shows the risks posed by the outlying of the agreements in the Stability and Growth Pact .
I believe , therefore , that it would be very sensible to consider how we can best use the savings in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and , as is clear , necessary financial instrument with the sole aim of supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewable energy sources .
The Commission and Parliament have deliberately chosen not to raise the issue of dealing with the funds , because we are all subjecting the presumption that the sector will keep its promise to tackle this issue on its own , without any pressure from the legislator .
This brings me to two issues relating to the Europe 2020 strategy .
( EL ) Madam President , as far as industry is concerned , I should like to remind the House that Pakistan is in the fourth place in the world for cotton production , with a share of 9 % of world production , and then called the European Union by little below 5.5 % .
In this case , the Council and , above all , Parliament is also involved in deciding on the composition of the Commission as a collective body and on the portfolios that you are about to entrust and on the programme for the next five years that you will be presenting .
We need to be aware that things were started a year ago and that we need to go further in 2009 .
Of course , this affects the behaviour of the Portuguese people , because the country is already in recession and the living conditions of workers and people are worsening , inequality is widening and poverty is also on the rise .
( BG ) Presidents of the Commission and the Council , these objectives have already been formulated in the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
We have already worked with many Arab countries on initiatives to obtain gas through Turkey , to hope for the Nabucco pipeline .
That is why taking action to completely remove it is the objective of health policy , for which the governments of individual countries can best contribute , showing flexibility .
As this is my last speech in this House , I would like to thank all colleagues and employees for their cooperation .
I realise that there are currently significant differences between the regulations concerning elections in the various Member States .
Very general doctors obviously start treating anti-dementia medicines too late , so that they do not exceed their budgets , and that is counterproductive .
Paradoxically , this instrument can easily be abused in practice , and not only by extremists , but also by powerful interest groups , and I say this because we believe that a threshold of 1 000 statements of support is not a large threshold compared with the Union &apos;s demographic potential .
The 2010 budget creates this systemic approach .
According to a report from the UN Working Group , the victims of trafficking are from various public prosections , from the most affluent to the poorest , from the best educated to totally illiterate , from just young to elderly women .
This is indeed an important issue .
We need greater and better European economic governance of national actions to support this line , including the financial transaction tax , which I call on the Commission to consider very carefully , including in a European context .
I believe that the mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important because it is not just about healthcare , but also about follow-up care , but we have a deadline in which this detail can be finalised .
Firstly , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports , which raise important issues regarding the contribution of European Union trade policy to the achievement of certain fundamental objectives of public policy : respect for human rights , economic welfare and social justice , achieving sustainable growth and respect for the environment , and , in particular , the climate system .
Consumers will be able to benefit from a number of compensation in the event that their purchase does not comply with the contract , and may require notification of defects if the product is not corrected or replaced .
Mr President , the reason for this urgency is the brutal murder of 57 people who accompanied a politician when he went to register as candidates in the elections for the position of governor of a province .
This new , intelligent , symmetric system will lead to closer monitoring , to more thorough assessments by the Commission , the European Parliament , the Council and the European Central Bank , and to the drafting of recommendations for additional reforms and corrective plans .
The Syrian people deserve long-awaited political reforms , especially with regard to freedom of expression , assembly , political participation and governance .
Many of them were UK citizens who trade inside and not outside the country , if I may say so .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has returned to growth in the third quarter of 2009 , which could lead us to believe that the worst is already behind our back .
In these circumstances , Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of public administration , speeding up reforms to the pension system and health , improving the functioning of the labour market and efficiency of the salary system , facilitating the functioning of the product markets and the business environment , as well as maintaining the stability of the banking and financial sectors .
We believe that the reference to the following in establishing agreements between sovereign countries is essential : respect for the sovereignty of the state and its populations , for mutual interests , mutuality and cooperation , while taking into account the characteristics of each country , assessing what each country can contribute to the agreement from an economic , social and cultural point of view .
I believe that the transition to a sustainable , green economy will develop even without imposing extreme legislative measures .
Everyone seems to forget about the US contributions , and of course NATO , about peace in Europe .
I think we need to look at this issue as an appropriate opportunity to tackle what Europe badly needs : economic growth , jobs , a dynamic sector of small businesses , more innovation , more efficient public procurement - these are the things on which our citizens will judge us .
I believe that it is not our job to predict possible events in these countries .
The second project includes concessions .
Madam President , during the European elections in 2004 , Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace and we therefore met many angry constituents in restaurants and institutions .
In fact , at a time of deep meltdown of national action , increasing the EU &apos;s budgets is an act of confidence in the joint project and strengthening the action taken at supranational level .
I am convinced that our message is a good one , so let us go out and make it public .
The report provides guidelines for how air agreements should be analysed in terms of the content and procedures to be adopted .
The language law creates disproportionality .
Perhaps once the Treaty of Lisbon finally entered into force on 1 December , the British internal political debate will also be able to remain outside this Chamber .
This is the difference between the actual situation and the unfeasible dream of the European Parliament .
Furthermore , we support the need for every national parliament to be fully in line with their budgetary rights and control rights in order to increase transparency , commitment and responsibility for decisions taken , including at European level .
Mr President , five questions have been raised plus two issues relating to economic governance and the Europe 2020 strategy .
I therefore believe that we should actively involve the national authorities , the European Commission , as well as the Members , in promoting SOLVIT .
It is a system based on real political lines and guiding principles ; but now , Mr Michel , on the main actors and the liberal rhetoric that led to today : the promotion of an agro-industrial model , together with the protection of the interests of the world &apos;s large agricultural and food industries , and the subsequent qualitative depletion of the world &apos;s agricultural industry ; the long years of unsuitable investment in agriculture and the replacement of the world &apos;s rural sector ; and of the protection from the replacement of the population , and of the replacement of the rural sector , as well as 70 % .
Economically , the amounts paid to producers are lower than their production costs , and the CAP must allow this problem to be resolved .
I would like to use this occasion to call on the Commission , during its contacts with the government , to insist on the implementation of this promise as long as it occurs with the Republic of Congo &apos;s legislation .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I fully understand the considerable interest in this Parliament in the action taken within and outside the Union to address the challenges faced by some Member States in terms of their public finances .
We sympathise with the wishes of the peoples who want better life , participation in power and a better future .
You even have the support of the Irish members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that follows , and indeed we must continue to make the world safer , fairer and fairer in the future .
My office has drawn up the informal anti-Syria sanctions document ; we are moving things forward .
The day in which we successfully release ourselves from poverty , the prism of Communism will disappear forever .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the revision of horizontal competition cooperation rules - B7-0565 / 2010 ) .
You fought for this together , whether you are synonymous or orange .
I believe that this procedure , as well as strengthening the European Union &apos;s public food safety policy , creates greater clarity for the Member States and for third countries exporting meat products to the EU .
In view of this , it seems stupid to seek an agreement with Mercosur , especially as the Swedish Food and Technology Institute has noted that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef may be 35 times higher than that of Irish beef .
Therefore , in accordance with the agreement reached with the Council , the following text should be added at the end of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the original regulation , which is Article 1 ( b ) of the regulation , paragraph 2 ( b ) of the amendment : &apos; The exchange rates drawn up for an annual review of the prices regulated in Articles 4a and 4b ( 3 ) , when currency charges are expressed in various euro &apos; .
Today , the Irish Government has requested and rightly received European solidarity .
Look at Ireland , for example , a country particularly affected by the financial crisis ; its partial monetary union protected it from a more serious crisis .
He fears German claims about drought properties , having listened to German politicians on this issue , I think it is absolutely right to fear .
increased aid from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund , as well as increased financial support for technical activities relating to the preparation and implementation of projects ;
If we do not do anything to make countries realise that it will have severe consequences if they implement irrational economic policies , we will get nowhere .
We also need to strengthen other activities aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change .
( Applause from the left )
As always with such complex issues , I have been very cooperative with my shadow team , Bernadette Vergnaud , Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle .
In Russia , freedom of the press and of the media is indeed a major problem .
It is also up to each Member State to decide whether to ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which are two main instruments introduced by the Council of Europe .
This is a structural dialogue that enables us to exchange views on issues that are relevant to us .
Thirdly , all the aspects of sustainability - to do everything possible for people who already have work and receive protection and some kind of help , not to lose their jobs and not to have to switch to retraining and upgrade skills after one or two years in order to find a new job ; to maintain existing jobs .
Madam President , our questions are intended to highlight the benefits that our citizens can expect from such a package of measures and what we can propose in this package .
I voted in favour of this report because it also makes some significant improvements to the European Commission &apos;s text concerning the protection of personal data .
In addition , we have revised the unused funds from the 2009 budget so that we can provide a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband in category II .
Thank you very much for your proposal and for your very clear message .
We also note something from it and an attempt to take the holistic approach that did not succeed just as we had imagined , but nevertheless it is the right direction .
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission , which has sometimes been a bit of power , and the Council , in which we tried to find sensible solutions during the night meetings and many trialogues , because just one hour ago they also approved the sensible compromise that we found .
In order to ensure thorough and coordinated action , the Commission , together with Eurocontrol , following the Transport Ministers &apos; meeting on 4 May 2010 , created a European aviation unit for crisis coordination .
At the same time , it is important to remember that it is very rare that the problem itself , in this case , illegal logging , is the guilty of creating the conditions for the trade in illegal timber .
In fact , I come from - Portugal , and the region - the Azores , where the dairy sector is of great importance and is concentrated in regions that are socially vulnerable and where , in fact , maintaining the quota system and after 2015 will be vital .
People are not the product of different cultures , but different cultures are the product of different people .
In fact , in some cases , they are so good that they should be taken into account .
( SV ) Mr President , Iceland is a small nation in terms of its population , amounting to approximately 300 000 people , but it is a great nation .
Mr President , MEPs have an important role to play in overseeing health claims decisions .
For this reason , we say a firm &apos; yes &apos; to Nabucco , but we are also determined to support the efforts of our governments to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the wellbeing of our citizens .
Political parties can be banned ; there is corruption in the judiciary ; there are violations of human rights ; freedom of speech and association do not exist in the same way as in countries as Britain or most European countries .
It is also very obvious that we need an energy mix containing various energy sources that are as widely based as possible , as this will stabilise the energy situation and , as a result , the diverse needs of each nation and of Europe will be met .
However , I have some doubts when Parliament refers to international law in condemning certain unpleasant practices when the legal basis for this is far from clear .
By voting for the motion for a resolution on Tunisia , I clearly express my full support for the Tunisian people and for the historical democratic revolution that he started .
It also calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies , such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty , and to report back regularly on their actions to address this problem .
If you read a law in the Hungarian Parliament and you stipulate that from now on , it can only be modified by a two-thirds majority , you know that it will not be easy to change it again after the next elections .
O-tariff preferences ( debate )
Today in plenary , we voted on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
The subject of a new sense of mutual trust presents us with another major problem .
This year we have allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS , but we will not be able to estimate the real costs after the first year of operation when a report on all expenditure relating to the work of the EEAS will be submitted to the European Parliament .
My question concerns Pakistan , whose chronic instability , as we all know , is a factor in the crisis in the whole region and also for Afghanistan .
Of course , we cannot ignore the natural biological differences between men and women .
We must not forget either these factors , including when it comes to the idea included in the proposal to allocate revenue from infrastructure charges appropriately .
( HU ) Mr President , what I welcome in the directive is a clearer definition of patients &apos; rights , the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed solution to the issue of the lack of specialists in a given country .
Mr President , if you will just allow me to make some comments directly on the topics and questions that have been raised .
Last week in committee , I accused the Belgian Presidency of having recognised cancer .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran , as I am alarmed by the constant violation of human rights there , particularly with regard to freedom of association , expression and information , and because I support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people .
In particular , the rapid launch of funding will be very important .
It is one thing to establish such a mechanism , but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens to enable them to take full advantage of it .
It will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive , it will also make them safer , because regulators and enforcement bodies cooperate more closely in all matters relating to certification , inspection and enforcement , in order to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and freight flights .
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a thorough debate on the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) .
Moreover , its legal aspects not only enrich the image that Europe is presenting in the world , but also promoting European citizenship .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are debating today aims to amend the regulations adopted in 2004 relating to the protection of passports and travel documents for EU citizens against counterfeiting and , at the same time , to introduce elements for biometric identification .
Secondly , a kind of temporary institutional framework must be created for the mechanism for implementing decisions .
However , from a positive point of view , some of the agreements that we have recently concluded are very good , such as the Korea Free Trade Agreement .
This is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade understands that its current approach to constructive work with the European Union is far more effective than it seeks to transmit history all the time .
Strangely , but to this day , the European Commission has not found the necessary arguments , nor the time to influence the Latvian Government to put an end to linguistic discrimination .
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to link all forms of assistance to the Pakistani Government to the urgent elimination of this fatal discrimination against religious minorities in the country .
This will be an effective tool for stopping illegal immigration , organised crime and human trafficking .
This is permissible and legitimate and we have fought for it .
Obviously , now more than ever , financial institutions need to stop and rethink their approach .
Our common aim is to minimise the catches and discards , and we have achieved this when considering it in committee .
The main objective of the trade support strategy is to increase the local and international competitiveness of 48 countries .
Even if we adopt the justification for internalising external costs as a valid point of departure , it is ultimately untenable to penalise only heavy goods vehicles , rather than ordinary cars , in order to limit congestion , precisely as well as the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle , applies in a clearly discriminatory manner .
I am encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary debate .
Moreover , when we look at the starting point , we have some concerns .
The main objective of the European Union and the governments of the Member States , be they centre-right or centre left , is to safeguard the constant profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the crisis to the capitalist economy on to the working classes throughout the European Union .
Therefore , the dissemination of good practice must be encouraged and local decision-making bodies awareness of the opportunities to exploit ICT potential .
Mr President , we did not hear an interpretation in English in the last speech .
However , there is a rather significant aspect to this recast , this codification , which relates to the general restructuring of the TEN-T networks over the next decade .
( LT ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the Ukrainians , but let us not forget that it is also very important for the people of the European Union , because Ukraine is our important partner , especially in connection with the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in relation to Eastern Europe .
Therefore , the Commission must be convincing .
We cannot interfere with a matter where the US Government alone is competent .
The people who govern forests receive little or do not receive any pay for printing these hidden functions , which many people accept for granted .
Unfortunately , it also has to be said that the list of outstanding problems becomes longer than shorter .
With regard to Mr Salafranca &apos;s worthy report on the strategy for relations with Latin America , I would like to call on the Council and the Commission , which are currently represented in Baroness Ashton , to take urgent action on three issues .
There are large dealers with a strong presence on the market in some Member States , there are also very small dealers , who are more pleased with what we are now proposing than what has been going on since 2002 , as they have seen that certain aspects unforeseen by the legislation in 2002 were not in their interests , but rather they were difficult to withstand competition from large dealers .
It must build the EU &apos;s &apos; regional political partnership for peace , security and development in the Horn of Africa &apos; , which the Development Committee launched with the adoption of its report in April 2007 .
In those years , especially since historical enlargement in 2004 , the context and ambition of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) has changed a great deal .
Spain is taking up the baton of the Presidency of the European Union precisely when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force .
In this respect , it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is consistent with the objectives outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda , and that it is also one of the priority actions provided for in the Single Market Act .
I would like to strongly support Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposal .
Following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs , the Commission &apos;s proposal was amended in accordance with the report voted on now .
This is why it is important that we reach agreement at first reading .
These are the most deprived , and they must not be excluded because of their location .
All medical assistance , regardless of its distinctive features , falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union .
However , I would like to draw the House &apos;s attention to the fact that a recent study by the European public by way of Ceterology has again confirmed the great limits to this methodology resulting from the small number of women taking part in such tests .
The idea is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , but that they should not prevent us from meeting our social or environmental targets .
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the recovery of organic waste , especially in this highly agricultural region , to be verified and for a system for exchanging best practices to be established .
The law stipulating that legal priests , bishops and patriots must be Turkish citizens is totally incomprehensible .
The most important thing in the position adopted by the European Parliament is the attention it draws to the separation of measures , which is why there can be no coherence , not only as a legislative body , but also , in particular , as regards their implementation .
( RO ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has provided the European Union &apos;s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
At least the subject of the digital Single Market has made a breakthrough in EU priorities .
This would represent a significant step towards transparency , openness and clarity in the European process .
( DE ) Mr President , I support the proposal of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) because it is quite logical to debate this issue .
Is this the economic development model that Europe must offer to Europeans ?
As a rule , I do not allow the speakers to exceed the allocated time , but I believe we all agree that Mrs Tzavela &apos;s statement was particularly important to us .
We want a proper strategy that is based on new technologies , innovation and investments and which , once implemented , will ultimately improve the quality of life for all European citizens in the Danube region .
This is indeed a major achievement , given that , without entry into the legal basis considerations , this directive recognises the indisputable rights of patients and opens up a new range of possibilities for their access to better treatment .
Year after year , the Court of Auditors was unable to present to us with satisfactory facts that the EU budget was spent legally and correctly , and I was really concerned about the lack of control of taxpayers &apos; money when I was the chief accountant of the European Commission in 2002 .
For me , this is both a huge challenge and a great honour .
To be honest , we must recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and that our per capita emissions are still in the wider than those of China or India , for example .
I am sure that the resultant dialogue will be constructive .
We therefore regret that , as in the case of Europol , the haste has prevailed over the desire to guarantee fundamental freedoms .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal aimed at introducing an additional and simpler method for using the European Social Fund &apos;s reserve , with a view to ensuring the possibility of responding more quickly and effectively to the economic and social difficulties facing Europe .
To be very frank , I had to vote against the Commission &apos;s proposed composition but , in addition to the weak candidates , there are a few very good ones , including the Polish candidate , Janusz Lewandowski .
You are very kind , Mr Kirkhope , but in fact , in addition to Britain , there are 26 other Member States in the European Union , so you will , I suppose , understand that although we are very sympathetic to the concerns that you have expressed , I also have to listen to other legitimate concerns .
I believe that we need to be careful to maintain the neutrality of EU humanitarian aid , even if it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas .
Furthermore , I would like to add new points to what Parliament has already stated before , such as the request for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , and Vice-President of the Commission , to assess the results of the investigations carried out by all the parties and to report to Parliament ; recalls that the responsibility and confidence of the EU and the Member States require full control of investigations , and expresses concern over the pressure on non-governmental organisations involved in the drafting of the Goldstone report and in the follow-up to their investigations and to the controls imposed by them .
I also hope that the solution will help save extinction of fish species .
I hope that you will accept my questions not as provocation , but as help for thought .
I have always wanted - and I hope I have succeeded - to give feedback to what results we have achieved , but we also need to check the things we find .
This result will strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating position in international trade negotiations , especially in the World Trade Organisation &apos;s Doha Round negotiations .
When Europe speaks with one voice , then the United States of America will accept the same objective .
For this reason , I personally support the prices allocated to European tobacco producers , at least as long as people continue to smoke in Europe .
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States , it is very clear that some countries are addressing the problem more seriously than others .
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund ( ESF ) that is separate from European structural policy .
The number of new infections continues to exceed the spread of treatment , and two thirds of the needy of one in 2009 did not receive it , meaning that 10 million people in need had no access to their necessary effective treatment .
In fact , when human dignity is valued , we do not consider minorities at all in a negative way .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s proposals to simplify this fund .
In the future , all EU institutions should ensure that our budgets are aimed at helping individuals and businesses overcome difficult economic times and planning recovery .
The quickest way to delete them in a much more effective and practical way than all the measures &apos; bottom-up &apos; is to support citizens &apos; initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions .
To those who are still struggling today to defend this treaty , with the false conviction that it strengthens the European Union , I would say , by supporting it , they actually strengthen our so-called partners or , if you want , opponents .
The review of global capitalism in Europe is the backbone that will put all of us .
We will soon hold a meeting on the trans-European transport network , at which the Commission will move forward with the development of a network of alternative means of transport .
You will remember this violent battle because it came to the Court and the Commission - I should pay tribute to the last one - was clear , clearer at the time than the Council and we fully supported it .
The first person who asked for the floor this morning was Mr Madlener .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski &apos;s report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
( DE ) Mr President , the line adopted by the governments of the main EU Member States , the European Commission and the European Central Bank is clearly evident .
Indeed , I have to remind the House that , according to the last counties in the European Union , there are still more than 20 million unemployed - their number has probably already reached 25 million - which means that more asylum seekers will be accessed , in fact , is a kind of collective suicide .
The Commission must impose sanctions , not finance ministers .
For its economic recovery , Sri Lanka depends on direct foreign investment and on the EU &apos;s economic support .
We fully support the aim of the vaccine initiative , but we cannot support a reference which brings us back to another parliamentary vote , which , among other things , supports an interruption and contrary to the previous explanations of vote that we have listed in the Minutes of Parliament .
This document is the result of a compromise after lengthy negotiations , which improves the implementation of passengers &apos; rights without imposing an additional burden on carriers .
It is indeed high time that the &apos; I &apos; in the EMU squabbled to breathe life into through the creation of a real and effective economic union as a last step in the integration of European economic policy .
I am particularly interested in the issue of children &apos;s rights in the context of external relations .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , for ten years now , the European Union has been trying to arm itself with legislative instruments in the area of economic immigration .
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for removing national administrative and technical obstacles preventing the marketing of construction products in the European Union and for continuing to build a single market in this sector .
I believe that if we really want to stick to the objectives that we have set for our foreign policy in the Treaties , we have a long way to go before we can return to Libya the migrants who are now residing illegally in the EU .
I therefore supported the resolution on European innovation partnerships within the Innovation Union flagship initiative , and I believe that we should all engage with innovation because , as I have already said , they are very important for the future .
In the UK , we have a newly elected government that has given promises in this area .
The next item is the report by Mr Alves , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 247 / 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255 / 2009 - .
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand and thus lead to a positive result , both for the environment and for the creation of jobs .
There are countries that do not use the funds made available to them by the ESF , leaving 30 % or 40 % unused .
In fact , this leads me to ask myself the question - even if the Commission says it has the information and publishes it - of having an obligation to publish it , for example , why it was not known .
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I strongly support the proposal for an effective information campaign .
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and wants to make the achievement of economic policy objectives mandatory .
Today , I voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation in connection with unitary patent protection because I believe that the impasse in the Council as a result of the language regime is unjustifiable .
Once again , the Treaty makes it clear that a Member State cannot be forced to shoulder debt .
I would like to remind you of the joint decision of the European Parliament and the Council to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
Let me assure this House that we will continue to raise these issues , including at the highest level , by recalling the international obligations of the People &apos;s Republic of China regarding human rights .
I hope - and I am sure - that you will provide the basis for an agreement with your votes .
Firstly , I am sorry that Commissioner McCreevy , Commissioner McCreevy , is not here ; perhaps the season has started again .
You probably do not know , but extensive animal testing needs to be carried out , for example , to confirm such an allegation .
There is also something that leads me to be alert , Commissioner Verheugen , and that is the great influence of the CARS 21 group , and the impact of the industry on the process that we are launching here .
We do not agree with that .
EU aid planned for the 2007-2010 period and intended to support the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova amounts to EUR 50 million .
Of course , we cannot understand how an illegal worker is employed and the one who employs him to ensure his or her residence and expenses is ultimately punished .
I believe that this measuring system , based on various research parameters , will lead to political solutions that are more suited to the needs of society and the economy as a whole .
At the same time , I would like to point out that political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must also depend directly on removing restrictions on freedoms and ending repression against peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists .
Finally , High Representative , you will travel to the Middle East .
Worse still , the US Congress has taken away , just a month since the creation of the ICC in July 2002 , adopted the law on the protection of American military personnel .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like briefly to explain that this report includes the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following the resolution adopted in this House on 19 June 2008 , which rejected the Commission &apos;s proposal aimed at authorising the placing of poultrymeat on the market for human consumption even after it was subject to anti-microbial processing .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to express my personal condolences about the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deep concern for the other four Cuban prisoners and an opposition activist who began a hunger strike in protest .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements : Multiannual Programme 2010-2014 on the area of freedom , security and justice ( Stockholm Programme ) .
It should be our motto not to waste a single cent .
The Union , in particular , the Mediterranean countries , has always been the first to provide humanitarian aid to Sahrawi , because the principle of solidarity with people living in such troubled circumstances is fundamental .
Often , workers themselves are isolated and , in this situation , access to trade unions is often very difficult .
( Laughter and applause )
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the Commission and its two Commissioners for their statements today .
At present , and although some amendments have helped to improve the situation , Mrs Guillaume &apos;s report is a real incentive for people to abuse this process by overloading the relevant services and placing those who really need a rapid review of their cases .
The time has come for us , and we have a responsibility to do everything we can ; I would like to thank the authors , Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer , for their excellent work , which benefits everyone .
We have indeed implemented a huge programme with some major , important reports .
So-called social dumping poses a major threat to workers , because it undermines their rights in a fundamental way .
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure respect for human rights in the Republic of Congo .
( EL ) Madam President , I should like to ask , in relation to what the Commissioner said about assessing any proposal , whether a preliminary study can be carried out into the area in question , including on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and specific features in the area , so that there are criteria which each country will have to take into account from the outset and comply with them at the planning stage .
We also need to address the issue of Roma women , who are facing particular problems of poverty , access to housing , discrimination and violence ; and also the problem of young Roma , because depriving them of their qualifications even more difficult to access employment in the current period of economic crisis .
I am delighted to vote in favour of this amendment in respect of the ERDF with a view to extending its interventions in the housing sector to support marginalised communities in all Member States .
It is also a reminder to all politicians in their area of competence that , in order for press freedom , public authorities really must play their part : they must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and promote its development .
Mr President , I think the European Union has become too great and has involved too many cultures in itself ; I simply do not trust the system as a whole , and things are getting worse .
It is still too early to announce the results of this analysis and , as the Member knows , every step in this process requires unanimity in the Council .
It is important to point out that the EU &apos;s integration prospects serve as the strongest incentive for Balkan countries to undertake the necessary reforms and also as a factor for regional stability .
Once advertising now has such a big role , it is particularly important to define the criteria allowing consumers and patients to be fully aware and secure about the effects of these medicinal products .
No Ar-Germanning would say that this is a small step for European funds , but a major step for the European economy .
Thirdly , the loopholes about security , which it has been said many times that they will appear if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement , simply do not exist .
Furthermore , the rapid dissemination of the Internet and e-commerce over recent years has led to an increase in the supply of online games and the resulting cross-border issues , which remain unresolved .
All persons making decisions in this area must have equal access to professional information about the candidate &apos;s country of origin and the bodies authorised to deal with complaints , and the same applies to asylum applicants .
I therefore appreciate , after all these years , the importance of constructing the only multinational parliament elected by universal suffrage .
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion per year on defence , and this EUR 200 billion needs to be spent more sensibly than in the past .
Together , we have achieved positive changes .
In addition , we will work on services of general interest during this parliamentary term .
Can I therefore suggest that we get Mr Almunia , the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs , because he was rather critical of certain countries during his mandate and then the Greek question then arose .
In this respect , there is a great need for reform in Turkey .
The EGF has already been used by other EU countries , particularly Portugal and Spain , so we should now grant aid to Lithuania .
Upper fuel and radioactive waste ( debate )
I will limit myself to mentioning recent events , such as the destruction of Christine City in the town of Vion Long , whose place appears to be public park , or the deployment of police forces to combat mass unrest and bubble Moldovans to abolish the status of Delta Marta from the Catholic genital Islands in Hanoi .
Furthermore , the fund plays an important role in training workers , lifelong learning , improving employment opportunities and integrating workers into the labour market .
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law ( announcement of motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
For this reason , I am voting to reject the Commission &apos;s proposal .
This has been done now and I supported the proposal during the vote .
There is only one solution : growth .
