This means that we offer Belarus an opportunity to move closer to the European Union through the European Neighbourhood Policy .
I also call on the Presidency of the Council to make similar statements about this event as our resolution , and also in June , on the occasion of the Jan Men massacre .
I therefore support the obligations of the Treaty of Lisbon to combat social exclusion and discrimination and to promote social justice and protection .
The EU is like buildings and any reference to stopping its enlargement would therefore be contrary to the principles on which it stands .
I hope that , with today &apos;s vote , the European Parliament has contributed slightly to the conservation of fish stocks and a healthy marine environment , as well as to the reform of the common fisheries policy .
Firstly , I must appoint a former South African President and the President of the African Union , Thaba Mbeki , and his mediation ; and I think we should also stress the media role played by our own special representative in Sudan , Rosalind Marson .
I thank the players in the social economy who have taken steps to enable this Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission in order to finally recognise a common European set for mutual societies , associations and foundations .
With regard to the financial markets , let us talk about the financial markets as part of the economy , not as part of a separate sector , because if we consider them to be a separate matter , we will never get investment and new jobs .
Elections have been declared and candidates , as we see from the media , are progressing because they realise that there are no democratic conditions for holding elections .
Businesses operating in Europe know that their claims will be dealt with within 60 days in the future .
( HU ) Mr President , I welcome with gratitude and appreciation the inclusion of the agenda for the protection of traditional national and ethnic minorities , as well as immigrants to Europe .
The packages deal with four basic security issues - security and communications , entertainment , withdrawal and virtual violence - and they provide assistance for families with the safe use of the Internet .
I think that much more information is needed .
On the whole , however , I can recommend that discharge be granted to the financial year 2008 for the area for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible .
Children need to grow up in a safe environment , for which parents are responsible .
Indeed , we must consider how to use the limited resources we have very actively and deliberately .
So what we have done - throughout the world , not just in the United States of America - has been building a debt game .
We do not know what will happen by 2020 , which is why I support the report .
We all remember - and those of the elderly of us will remember very well - the problem of asbestos building in Berlaymont , which has been closed for five or six years .
Mr President , it is clear that Kashgar is indeed a symbol of par excellence in Uyghur cultural identity in China &apos;s Xinjiang province .
Mr President , today &apos;s debate has been very encouraging on matters of agriculture from all sides of the House .
Similarly , we propose that progress be made in carrying out cost-benefit analyses .
Membership of committees and delegations : see Minutes
However , I think , and I think most Members &apos; concerns , that we need to be very careful about what forms and means we use to give a swift and immediate relief to this vulnerable economic sector .
It is therefore very important that we do not just carry out a technical review of the Treaties and that we focus on two of the biggest weaknesses of the euro area , which the crisis has highlighted .
That is why we are proposing regulations and guidelines which will extend the choice and opportunities for small businesses throughout the whole chain from replacement manufacturers to repair vehicles .
Absolutely .
Today , following the events that have taken place in Georgia and the Russian recognition of the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Russia &apos;s readiness to build a common security area with the European Union is increasingly being weakened than ever , and the positions of both sides on issues relating to Kosovo and common neighbours are increasingly different .
We are working on a common European Union standard on minority rights , which is an absolute must .
However , monitoring macroeconomic imbalances and disparities in competitiveness are mainly guaranteed by those EU Member States who joined the euro due to the higher degree of economic and financial impact of cure in euro area Member States ; lower market discipline ; the absence of exchange rates and more demanding adaptation to potentially high costs for the euro area as a whole .
For my country and , in particular , for the citizens affected areas , it is important that this decision is approved by the European Parliament .
In order to make European energy policy acceptable , it is not enough , in the form of an amendment , to supplement the word &apos; solidarity &apos; ; moreover , the same amendment prohibits the EU interfering in the functioning of the market .
The aim is to remove the procedure that is common in the rail sector - to apply national standards which prevent the approval of rolling stock already approved in other countries .
However , we can already understand that racism and xenophobia still persist in the European Union and that they have an impact on the life of members of ethnic minorities .
This means that , if we are to be able to protect consumers in such a gap and if we want to have a high level of consumer protection in Europe , we must revise this Package Travel Directive and we must also consider whether , as my fellow Member has already said , we need to have specific arrangements for air passengers .
However , despite many successes of medicine , the spread of cancer in today &apos;s world has reached epidemic benchmark .
According to recent reports , the Stern magazine was at least 76 German MEPs involved in this fund .
Commissioner , I have been asking for other reports and have not been given the floor .
And we also need a serious information campaign sponsored by the European Union .
Perhaps you will not be surprised that I am a decisive supporter of the first of these solutions .
We need to create an appropriate framework for our contractual relations , even if the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is too limited and does not permit it .
On the other hand , however , I am also a pessimists because , on the subject of the common agricultural policy , this document raises many times the public goods and services that agriculture must provide to people , but rarely refers to primary agricultural production and the competitiveness of this sector .
While I would like to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and all the affected and the support of the local authorities , I would like to take the opportunity of this forum to call on the European Community , since such a situation requires , as has already been said , a European response and , above all , European solidarity .
I think that my comments on the reports and on their conclusions can be fairly brief .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in recent times , the Bulgarian public has witnessed the publication of a number of information they have talked about the use of special monitoring facilities to listen to people in high government positions .
The only thing that can help Europe to prevent an influx of the least educated and deprived migrants , looking for their place in the world , is a well-considered and coherent migration policy such as Canada and New Zealand , as the previous speakers have said .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - Mr President , I would like to congratulate my colleague , Mr Szymański , on an excellent report .
You are known with your determination to fight climate change and you are respected in this House .
Yesterday evening , the Commissioner heard this report loud and clear , and I am very pleased that he promised us more information .
Apart from the serious human consequences of 42 deaths , several injured and several homeless people , the sharp rain affected by Madeira on 20 February has had countless effects and serious material damage .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
In order to promote stability between our eastern partners and minimise impact on Member States , the EU must adopt a tough policy towards Russia , which should be designed in close cooperation with transatlantic partners , as well as regarding the relevant multilateral organisations , as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
We can ensure this success and therefore everyone - Parliament , the Commission , the Council and the European Central Bank - will join us in our hearts and find a successful way forward .
Moreover , the Council of Ministers has not yet joined , which means that we do not even have all the legislative bodies in place .
The Maritime Transport Strategy 2018 has been used profoundly within the framework of the Commission &apos;s Europe 2020 strategy and has already started a process which will lead to the drawing up of a White Paper on Transport .
Some of the world &apos;s largest retailers , such as Carfia or Wal-Mart , have already prohibited Brazilian beef due to the fact that the industry that produces it is responsible for deforestation .
As a result of the financial and economic crisis , Iceland has become the world &apos;s fifth wealthiest country , exacerbated by the failure of its banking system , with 40 % of households unable to pay their bills and pensioners losing their lives savings .
The introduction of the proposed solutions makes sense if the data is not additional , in other words , if the Member States are actually able to collect this data using existing data sources .
We have only had a scandal in the University of East Anglia in recent months , then the debate on the Himalayan glaciers and now the questions about the impact of climate change on wild animals in the Amazon are raised .
He is fighting with you !
Let me first answer Mr Papanikolavoui .
The EU must continue to exert pressure on Mugabe and should the EU be involved as an observer when elections are held .
As you know , investment is a new border for a common trade policy .
The EHEC pathogen was and should not have been there .
In my constituency , those who have lost their jobs due to the closure of two companies - Waterford Crystal and Dell - could qualify .
The EU-Africa strategy will be put into practice in accordance with the Action Plan adopted for the period 2010-2013 , which is aimed at eight priority areas already set out at the Lisbon Summit in 2007 .
One example is the mobility of young people .
The right to compensation for the average ticket price in the event of cancellations , rebookings or significant delays lasting at least two hours will now become a reality for all passengers .
There is no such thing .
In accordance with paragraph 15 of this resolution , I consider it essential that all trade agreements contain agreed social and environmental standards , including : a list of minimum standards , which all EU trading partners must observe ; a list of additional provisions that need to be applied and flexible with a view to the economic situation and social and environmental issues of the partner .
( LT ) Madam President , the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is extremely important to protect the environment and protect society .
Even at the beginning of this year , the main Canadian negotiator admitted that this agreement is a top priority for Canada .
We have gradually realised this fact in the European Union , and energy security has become one of the strategic priorities .
Perhaps this system does not provide the necessary economic flexibility and self-determination to enable governments to address their specific problems effectively , such as inflation rates .
I believe that the equal involvement of women in the management of resources , in economic opportunities and in the governance and political life will have a positive impact on the economic development of our society , thereby strengthening the capacity of countries to develop , reduce poverty and function effectively and effectively .
No !
It is a big mistake and it is dangerous to mix up peaceful protests and crimes , such as those committed in Athens .
In fact , we chose in the reports by Harbour and Trautmann .
This resolution covers a number of important issues .
We can therefore end up on a veto , which is very important , particularly before the elections .
In order for the European Union to be a credible player in this peace process , it must be demonstrated that it is consistently , in any case and in all matters , the fundamental values of the EU apply in all context and in accordance with international law of the acquis .
The creation of a unitary European patent within the European Union will bring with it benefits for all those involved and , in particular , for small and medium-sized enterprises , as this will contribute to their competitiveness by reducing costs .
The European Council in March is expected to present the European Parliament &apos;s position on this matter .
The key objective of these measures is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market , believing that any economic growth resulting from this will strengthen political stability throughout the region .
This Parliament has been asked to define the codecision architecture of SIS II , which in itself would ensure the security necessary for our area of freedom , security and justice .
Taoufik Ben Brik has been sentenced in a fabricated process , taken far from his family , which is hardly impossible to visit , and is now in a state of health that probably threatens his life .
However , this positive trend has not been accompanied by the protection and promotion of passengers &apos; rights : passengers have highlighted many problems , including cancellation , book , loss of luggage or delay .
However , the first thing we need to tackle is food shortages , as one billion people are already suffering from hunger in the country .
Unfortunately , however , it seems that the real objective was to attack small and medium-sized enterprises and bring them to their knees .
I think that the issue of geographical balance , which is so often highlighted , could be resolved much better .
On the other hand , an alarming trend in media freedom cannot be ignored .
I really do not understand how many people can be criticised by the European institutions in this way , which is by abusing the death of so many people .
Let us be careful to welcome the Commission &apos;s important proposals for this report , believing that full recognition of the central role played by the urban dimension in EU policies is an indispensable condition for its success .
In today &apos;s vote , I supported the resolution on the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba .
In particular , we need to implement the recommendations adopted by this organisation to limit the current problem of overfishing in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean to tackle serious risks to the future of species , and therefore also to fishing themselves .
( FI ) Madam President , this debate has been very interesting and it seems that the European Parliament is very committed to supporting the climate conference in Copenhagen .
Irrespective of the events which have led to this conflict breaking out , the conflict already has a significant impact on civilians in the region and on the presence of the United Nations in Gaza .
I say this because the poorest , most vulnerable populations are suffering here , and we cannot ignore this .
I expect the same level of interest from the US authorities , as well as equal treatment of Member States in the visa waiver programme .
If Mrs Roure wants to travel to Lampedusa tomorrow morning , there will be no minors here , and if you read the Italian newspaper , she will find out that it was Mr Maroni who discovered the organ trafficking : children who come from Lampedusa on behalf of the left-wing governments in our country .
I do not deny that nuclear energy can form part of a balanced European energy corner and that its use can reduce our dependence on external resources in this area , but I do not believe that the European Union can avoid efforts to close this obsolete nuclear power plant to ensure that economic recovery projects are funded as they deserve .
The decisions made by the NATO Summit and also by the statements , such as the President of the United States , confirm that NATO is not opposed to the common security and defence policy , but rather seeks to find a way of cooperating beneficial to both organisations .
Mr Schmidt has tabled an amendment concerning the voluntary participation of non-euro area Member States in the sanction regime .
Mr Leinen &apos;s report shows how the treaty will influence Parliament &apos;s work and will deal very closely with the consequences of new policy areas , new powers and new processes for Parliament .
I do not want to accuse anyone , but experience shows that next time we have to do better .
Thank you very much .
We do not understand how this matter can be debated , hesitated and challenged in respect of the competences of the Union , when the Treaty makes it clear that this is an area for which the European Union is also responsible .
Minorities , particularly defenders , are persecuted .
We are all concerned about the protection of nature and public health , but we also need to maintain a balanced position .
Of course , we must now use it to achieve a Community policy on Community asylum and Community immigration .
The Afghans must adapt , and we must adapt to and help them achieve a state model of development with Afghan traditions .
I think this is the ideal time to review the fundamental points of this debate .
Moreover , due to the unchanging situation in Africa , Europe is increasingly afraid of an influx of immigrants who may be burdened by a social state .
The introduction of a minimum wage is a decision that should be left entirely to consider the Member States .
This motion for a European Parliament resolution concerns an EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
Moreover , the Council has reiterated the importance of further improving access to funding - I am referring here to credit , guarantees , interfinancing , etc. - as well as risk capital for new innovative businesses and for small and medium-sized enterprises , taking into account the consequences of the current financial crisis .
The future of the euro area and the future of the European Union are two sides of one coin .
Mr Verhofstadt , a liberal alternative , and Mr Juncker , a federalist alternative , was not acceptable .
Finally , the Agadiro Agreement should be extended to improve trade exchanges at South-South level .
I therefore hope that we can improve child safety by increasing the number of materials on the Internet , which can encourage , educate and develop them , instead of what we are seeing today , which unfortunately is so high on the Internet and which may undermine the overall growth in young people &apos;s personality .
That would be unfortunate .
The Members of the European Parliament have said &apos; no &apos; to flexibility and &apos; no &apos; to unacceptable pressure from France on the leading democratic body of the European continent !
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on what is happening in Afghanistan , our credibility as an international community is undoubtedly at stake .
However , our arguments must make sense so that people do not feel that the European Union is only interested in itself , but can see that it cares about the interests of its citizens .
This explains why Members are still unfairly encouraging Member States to accept these innocent detainees who cannot return to their country , because they are afraid of torture .
As is so often the case with European Union law , the Commission has been asked to submit a report on the application and implementation of the Statute for establishing whether or not amendments to this legislation are necessary .
The political parties &apos; bans are generally wrong , but there are exceptions to this rule .
There can be no denying that there have been radical changes in the area of tourism over the last 10 years , including through technological progress .
If Turkey unequivocally strives to establish good relations with its neighbouring states , settling outstanding problems in a peaceful manner and in accordance with the UN Charter and other European documents , then we can hope .
We have learnt from the past and discovered that we must take immediate action to prevent similar things happening again .
Then he then turned to the black henche of the ladies and gentlemen , saying , &apos; Mr President , if you want to sit , I have a ready place for you in advance in the first class &apos; .
Secondly , the concept of a points of single contact , which is already being used internally within the European Union , could be better used in the BRIC countries , in other words , Brazil , Russia , India and China , in order to increase exports and external investments that European companies can make .
You are presenting here a country where people opposed the fall of the Warsaw Treaty .
Under this directive , fund managers must be registered and entrusted and must observe the strict code of conduct within the European Union .
Three years ago , a report was adopted on visa facilitation with Russia , which included my amendment stating that the request to register constitutes a serious obstacle to travel between Russia and the EU .
People simply dream of a better life and a better life does not necessarily mean democracy .
It is clear that very often , residents of affected areas remain isolated from the means of transport to the country , and the capacity of civilian means is limited .
It points out that these policies must always be incorporated against the backdrop of respect for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Finally , I have added that we will hold this conference and I would like to hope , Baroness , that you will accept my invitation , at least for part , of your heating of course .
With my support for this report , I stress the importance of solidarity in our European societies , particularly this European Year for Combating Poverty .
We need to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and we fully support Olli Rehn &apos;s package .
I hope that the political will to write a new chapter in the OSCE &apos;s rich history will be able to materialise in Astana .
( FR ) Mr President , is Haiti doomed to disaster ?
The rule of law must be respected .
However , that is different !
According to the Copenhagen political criteria , Turkey is expected to ensure cultural diversity and promote the cultural rights of all citizens , as is stated in our accession partnership conditions .
The fact that Europe is concerned with its citizens has therefore been confirmed by Parliament &apos;s decision to find room for this fund in its 2011 budget , thereby giving it real meaning , despite substantially reducing the margin .
It is for this very reason that this parliamentary question in the committee was supported by such a large majority , which I very much welcome .
Finally , I would like to say that the fact that the rapporteur from one of the small groups has adopted such a complex document for the active cooperation of the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups is an important democratic signal on which this institution should be proud .
I think it is essential to support both SMEs and to fully liberalise the free movement of people , goods and services , as well as to maximise the profits derived from the single market .
However , there are other concerns .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 : 00 .
Mrs Swinburne &apos;s report comes at a moment when we are at an important juncture in the process of reforming the law .
Ladies and gentlemen , the part of what is required in this report is simply nonsensical and I will therefore vote against it .
However , we must now ensure in Copenhagen that the positive outcome last year is reached the Copenhagen level .
As regards disarmament or missile shield , the EU must make its position very clear with regard to Russia and the United States .
Of course , the instruments of cohesion , and above all the funds , must constitute real European added value for our fellow citizens , but today , during a period of deep crisis which has hit Europe , must be able to react more quickly and be better adapted , above all , to urban situation .
While with regard to the first problem , we have funds for development and cooperation programmes which are obviously still insufficient , in the second case , the problem is still being resolved in a variety of ways at Member State level .
We need to prepare a catalogue of all private quality certificates and a legislative framework needs to be adopted at European level to ensure that this system functions transparently .
Once the final rule for ESAT has been published , we will , of course , carry out a final assessment , and this assessment will also address the issue of the ESTA fee if the fee is actually in place .
Madam President , as we all know , many hazardous chemical substances are approved for use normally , even though they contain hazardous substances .
- ( FR ) Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , I have discovered the reason why you have not yet ratified the Treaty of Lisbon : they mention magicent of the Treaty of Lisbon , such as the majority of 2008 .
The Green &apos; New Deal &apos; , in other words , the new logic of an economic organisation based on innovation technologies and backed up by international capital markets , will be the cornerstone of an increasing number of rescue and stimulation programmes for the economy , including among the Member States of the European Union .
The bilateral agreements between some Member States in the implementation of projects such as Nord Stream raise a lack of confidence not only on environmental issues but also on the principle of solidarity - which is why transparency must prevail in this area .
I think that is a good thing , and it is important .
We all understand that we will have to fundamentally change the direction of current policy , which is very clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy .
However , it is now important for the Commission and the Member States to negotiate hard in Copenhagen .
My second point concerns the consideration of multilateralism , an idea which has so often been put forward in this House .
Many colleagues across the political groups have already shown that they are involved in this matter , but our duty is to put far greater political strength into this issue .
I believe that our overriding task is to complete the process of consolidating the Single Market as transparent as possible in close cooperation with the European Parliament .
I think I can do so by quoting a Dutch proverb : &apos; All monks in one Rules are to wear the same . &apos;
For this reason , I call on the European Ombudsman to make a strong appeal to national ombudsmen to regularly exchange views with their national parliaments following the example of discussions of the European Ombudsman with us in the European Parliament .
Firstly , it is about creating and protecting jobs , with the emphasis on questions not so much about social aid but , above all , about investing in infrastructure and restoring businesses so that these jobs can be created .
Madam President , Mrs Figueiredo has said so excellent , and I would just like to add one thing .
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the repeal of the former pillar system now fall under all the terms of the US visa waiver programme .
We therefore welcome this initiative by the Commission , together with my colleague , Mrs Lochbihler , to express our full support .
We have a fundamental problem , which concerns competition between two courts , the Strasbourg Court and the European Court of Justice .
This concerns harmonisation of size , social labelling and , above all , identification based on radio frequencies , which would lead to greater corporate costs and consumer prices .
( SV ) Mr President , Europe &apos;s current greatest failure is that we have not yet succeeded in putting an end to the human trafficking that is going on right before our eyes .
As you see in the functioning of Europe - European culture - an economic and social turning point is taking place .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , because it was important to raise this issue .
As this is a disease whose treatment is very expensive and the majority of patients cannot afford it , we need to increase the subsidies for these medicines .
Once again , on behalf of everyone here , I would like to express our deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims and their families .
If this process is reopened , I sincerely hope that the perpetrators will be caught and arrested , otherwise there is a risk of further bloodshed and that this will be regarded as a kind of kind of spare .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
We must appeal to regional and local authorities , as well as to all the other stakeholders , and urge them to use this second chance with all urgency .
The European Union must adopt budgetary control mechanisms that are effective for preventing and detecting fraud in good time , so that public funds can only be used if they are genuinely correctly used , regardless of the effective punishment for those who violate the rules and who incorrectly seek to attribute these funds , which are already weaker in nature .
I must therefore express my disagreement with Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s opinion that , when reversed qualified majority voting , the whole package is toothless .
The challenges were enormous : there has been a transition from the legal system of the Treaty of Nice to the legal system provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon , and the next multiannual programme has been drawn up which will define priorities for the area of freedom , security and justice for the next five years .
I believe that here we have a currency that is really strong , including with a retrospective perspective .
That is the core of everything we do in that country to ensure that the rule of law actually works there , which , of course , also applies to the legal system , and also to the political and constitutional reform that is so essential .
In this context , the problems of operational needs and the harmonisation of the European Parliament &apos;s and the European Union &apos;s expenditure must be solved .
We know that .
This measure refuses to consider a proper assessment of these products before reaching the market and does not mention so many times the danger of GMOs trafficking .
You are right to say that , first and foremost , we must prevent a fire race from being made in this agricultural business .
The question of whether narcotics should be prosecuted is a matter for the rights of the Member States , and the EU should not seek to overturn the exercise of justice .
They are waiting for this .
The Member States must now take appropriate measures to prevent hundreds - if not thousands - of deaths in the poorest households of the continent .
So we will finish before the final vote .
No economic and regional integration will bring fruit if the Union does not have the courage to resolve existing conflicts under international law .
We now want to see that it will be implemented quickly and we call on the Commission to provide money to support this process .
I agree with the rapporteur when she states that the appropriate transposition , application and enforcement of the directives on unfair commercial practices between businesses and consumers and on misleading and comparative advertising are essential to achieving the objectives set by the directives , particularly given the different ways and systems for implementing and implementing and implementing the directives , the complexity of certain legal concepts contained in the directives , quality and the exhaustive nature of national practices and the directive .
The European Union should intervene by taking legislative measures to ensure gender equality and reduce the segregation of men and women in the labour market .
It is true that consumers are entitled to certain basic information of what it is produced , where it has been produced .
( PL ) Mr President , in the context of today &apos;s debate , I would like to draw attention to the controversial proposal to amend Article 47 of the Commission Regulation of 2006 .
I would also like to remind you of the World Trade Organisation Working Agreement , which includes a number of strategic options to help us overcome the crisis .
Given the serious consequences that bluetongue has for livestock farms , it should be adopted to facilitate best practices in the area of vaccination , which would protect farmers from cattle cattle mortalities , which may harm such farms by often leading to their destruction .
Closure of the sitting
Mr President , one of the changes that the Prime Minister spoke about this morning is the citizens &apos; initiative .
President-in-Office of the Council . - In December 2008 , the Poznań conference agreed on the 2009 work programme , which clearly identified the steps towards the Copenhagen conference on climate change in December 2009 .
The final draft agenda for this part-session , as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday , 5 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure , has been distributed .
The aim of the proposal in question is to ensure that consumers in all 27 Member States can rely on a high level of consumer protection and that all businesses are able to supply goods and provide services to consumers in all 27 EU Member States without unnecessary legal obstacles .
We must maintain its merits .
I believe that we must vote in favour of the report by Claude Moraes , as it is part of the general package governing the European Union &apos;s asylum and migration system .
Thousands of young people are demonstrating on the streets and requesting the government to start doing something , are asking the governments to reduce interest , they are asking their government to devalue .
Reforms of agricultural support for the EU &apos;s outermost regions create an important mechanism for maintaining agriculture and conserving the countryside .
If we purchase a new building and do not have more than one alternative , we can hardly achieve favourable conditions .
This financial instrument upholds the fundamental principle that all financial instruments should be complementary to each other .
I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the situation in Haiti one year after the earthquake : humanitarian aid and reconstruction .
I do not want to advocate any form of market protectionism , but I call for strict defence of proper market rules : rules that are healthy and fair .
In other words , detainees will have to wait until 2016 or 2017 for Turkey to take them back , given the crisis we are facing .
The European Commission shares the Member &apos;s belief that the growing number of children from the migrant environment is facing major challenges in most Member States .
Once this really happens , Members will have the opportunity to make legislative proposals , there will be any lobbyist group of their fellow Member who will serve its interests .
That is why I voted as I did .
Here , the European Economic Recovery Plan comes to the word , and the Lisbon Strategy also logically supports this .
in writing . - Today &apos;s Parliament has blocked authorisation to use thrombin as a food additive .
Where did solidarity be shared ?
Parliament has made this directive even stricter on some important points than the Council &apos;s common position .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns .
In accordance with the legal procedure , the Council will adopt the text after carrying out the usual legal and linguistic editorial activities , then the directive can be published within the Official Journal of the European Union within the maximum delay .
Domestic inspectors are not incorrect , but they are the best available technology at present , and we must use the tools we have within our reach to reduce the threat of terrorism .
We do not help them to suggest that they can escape from this path ; it is no help .
The decisive aspect of this initiative concerns fundamental values : respect for cultural and linguistic diversity .
In my home country , Estonia , this fund has not been used yet , and when I asked why this is the case , it was said to me that the conditions were very strict and that the limit , which has so far been 1 000 people , was not possible .
I believe that together , we will establish the basic principles that should guide and facilitate future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , it is very worrying to see an increase in the number of cruel , violent attacks on Christians and their communities .
Other proposals concern the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact , which also covers specific details of the debt situation , proposals to improve economic governance in the euro area , and the establishment of a sound and credible mechanism to prevent and address excessive debt in the euro area , which could include the establishment of a European Monetary Fund .
Another problem is the service fee for outsourcing .
We do not want there to be a &apos; derogation &apos; , and we do not want a new Delaware in the European Union where companies can evade this type of legislation .
Firstly , the European Union budget for 2011 has set out priorities that must be strengthened as a result of the economic problems that have arisen throughout Europe following the eruption of the structural crisis of recent years .
We need to be able to safeguard farmers &apos; incomes and set in motion market mechanisms which will allow prices to be prevented and deter from occurring at present .
We need more employment , we need more equality between men and women , and we also need more education .
This proposal complements the current EC legal framework whereby discrimination on grounds of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation applies solely to employment , professions and training .
( The President cut off the speaker and called for order )
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station has caused a disaster on a huge scale , while the radioactive deployment has also affected many people who have been injured around the power station .
We need to evaluate and fully understand what we have , the effects that this has , what is possible , lacking and what goes beyond the necessary framework so that we can propose new and better thought through measures .
I believe that this is a collective responsibility and that it would therefore be healthy for everyone to contribute to resolving the crisis .
However , we have already discussed this comprehensive approach .
This 13th session is the most important one to meet in 2010 and will include high-level meetings and discussions with the government ministers on a number of important issues already mentioned by the Commissioner and the Minister , such as the impact of the global economic crisis on the human rights situation worldwide .
I also think that the number of errors or failures is relatively small - yet too few .
( CS ) The necessary proposal for a revision of the directive on late payments which we are discussing today is definitely better than the original proposal .
( Applause )

Before the end of my mandate , I would like to thank my fellow Members from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , who supported me and supported my report .
I do not want to shirk the answers , nor do I simply want to say that I will not respond , but you know very well that , if you ask about something in Parliament , it is possible that I will not want to use my position as President-in-Office of the Council with a question that is an internal matter for a Member State of the Union .
Texts of agreements forwarded by the Council : see Minutes

As the discussions have shown , there are great demands for this semester .

As the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , we support cooperation on illegal immigration to such an extent if we make it clear that we are also strongly going to fight illegal immigration .

( ES ) Madam President , we are talking here about more than 360 actions over the period of five years .

The EU is not democratic and is therefore not a suitable guardian of human rights .

In Poland , the country I represent is affected by Alzheimer &apos;s , and experts estimate that this number will triple by 2040 .
Since we have 27 countries with 27 different health systems , the Commission proposal based solely on Article 95 - a harmonised article - will result in the distribution of national healthcare systems and therefore also the seizure of responsibility from the Member States .
We believe that this would be completely unfeasible , costly and ineffective , particularly in schools where children are from a very different environment , and that this does not benefit the integration of immigrants into local communities .
I would also like to emphasise the recognition of traditional agricultural practices , particularly of organic and small-scale agriculture , which exist in disadvantaged regions and which represent not only economic value but , above all , ecological ones , as they are essential to preserving biodiversity .
If the specifications and the allocation of emission allowances are not proportionate , it will not be possible to prevent distortions in competition .

The European Union &apos;s presence in Kosovo is increasingly apparent , taking over office after the UN .
In more detail , the motion for a resolution contains aspects with which we cannot agree , particularly &apos; global emissions trading &apos; , given that this solution for reducing carbon emissions has already proven to be disadvantage , and this is about creating a greater number of partnerships between the public and private sectors , emphasising &apos; a significant increase in the proportion of public investment &apos; , which means the use of public funds for private interests and profits .
However , the practical aspect of the agreement with the size of the Congo raises a wide range of difficult obstacles .
As far as I am concerned , I think there is only one rasa - human race .
President Mubarak , in a situation in which he is today - and I respect his long struggle - is unable to conduct a political transition ; he is madness to ask him and leave Mubarak to settle the ElBaradei accounts on the streets .
The social situation is developing very favourably , the average income per capita has grown enormously , and the vast majority of Tunisians are now meeting the criteria of membership for the middle class .
I would like to make a few comments on the reports themselves .
In short , we are in the midst of a general crisis in the development model of our society , and yet we are still relying on the idea of a market that owes nature itself to private profit .
I therefore supported the report .
Cabotage should be liberalised , but it is still too early to do so .
Mr President , this Parliament is losing time by regulating things that the Member States should decide for themselves .
I do not believe in the constantly upgrading of new requirements and therefore Mr Oettinger is absolutely right .
You know what I am talking about : the very outrageous harassment of Ireland .
The instruments at their disposal should therefore be improved so that these organisations can operate more easily at European and national level .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
The opt-out that you want is still valid , as those who oppose progress have pushed it through it .

In the EU alone , 5.4 million tonnes of bananas were sold in 2008 .
However , I would like to stress that we do not have members of the Commission to represent their countries .

It is certainly possible to help poor regions of the EU by using good projects to combat climate change at the same time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce renewable energy and modern technological solutions .
All these elements create a whole that , in my opinion , enables us to come up with a comprehensive response .
I would also like to propose emphatically that the Union also decide to accede to the various useful additional protocols relating to issues such as opposition to violence or the fight against racism , as well as more effective legislation .
This is where it is .
It is the job of the Member States to safeguard and develop our forests for future generations with the support of the European Commission so that they can also contribute to our natural environment , our society and our economy in the future .
This is unacceptable .
( DE ) Madam President , Mr Chastel , landmines will probably also be a major problem in the more distant future .
We should pay more attention to rising youth unemployment , which is one of the most pressing problems .
The final draft agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure on 20 January 2011 has been distributed .
However , this form has been rejected by the Commission as &apos; incomplete &apos; , and I can confirm that , after almost five months , the Irish Government has still not made a full request .
Moreover , the Basque Euroview of Bayne-San Sebastián already has under-used international airports , far from any vulnerable natural areas .
In addition , the EU &apos;s common agricultural policy will have to adapt to the new economic and social conditions at local and regional level , taking into account the increase in energy costs .
I am grateful that I was able to take responsibility for this and that , as a citizen , I am , of course , still responsible for the Brandenburg that is my home , for the united Germany , for the country I love , and for a Europe whose unity is decisive for our destiny and future .
The ECR Group welcomes this debate .
The examples that our colleagues have put before us are speaking for themselves , and we can see that Turkey still has a very long way to go before reaching EU standards .

The world is changing , and it is simply necessary to accept this fact .

Mr President , Commissioner , we are completing the work started 10 years ago ; I am still very happy to equip myself with the outrage of the Erika shipbuilding in December 1999 : the speed with which Commissioner de Palacio put forward proposals at the time , in cooperation with the Council , which , under pressure from public opinion , was partly responsible for ensuring that the first measures and many other European ships were prepared by June 2002 , and by my first files , as a report on monitoring .
I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the directive .
Mr President , firstly accept Mr Šefčovič &apos;s apologies and Mr Oettinger , who are left empty by other matters and who asked me to stand down .
As the European Parliament resolution emphasises , if we do not urgently take steps to reverse this process , the loss of biodiversity will be considerable and uncontrollable in the medium and long term .

In order to achieve this objective , each individual must be actively involved , properly informed of how to protect the environment and take responsibility towards future generations .
Mr President , you have seen the situation yourself , but it is still going further and it is a collective punishment to punish innocent people there .
We do not forget that there is an ERTMS for railways , SESAR , GALILEO , but I think we are missing a user-friendly approach - as regards information for users on access to transport for persons with reduced mobility , and the possibility of adapting today to the cities when it comes to the introduction of energy-saving towns , where there is a very important issue of public transport .
We can be absolutely sure of this .
However , this is a political House , and we are all doing a tough policy as best we can .
Mr President , for the sake of welfare , our efforts made here in Parliament must not continue to be ignored .
On countless occasions , our ancestors have shown that our nations are able to unite if our destiny is at stake .

This means that if the same rules are applied in Portugal and other countries with weaker economies , the same policy and the same pressure , the differences will widen , and we will find ourselves in a situation that is increasingly serious , due to a lack of solidarity within the European Union .
The Commission is developing an integrated maritime policy - which also includes an external dimension - as well as integrated maritime monitoring across sectors and borders , in order to raise maritime awareness of offshore movements , which will improve maritime safety and security , as well as the enforcement of law .

I am in favour of Mrs Matias &apos;s report on the need to ensure closer cooperation and coordination between Member States which are able to respond effectively to the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease , with this disease today suffering from 6 million Europeans .
Similarly , it is with our support for clean technologies , where multinational companies are making original technologies available to them again at a high price to sell them to the same population that has produced them .
I call on the regional Council and the preferees in the French overseas departments , such as the Structural Funds authorities , to anticipate these changes , so that their regional programmes can be immediately focused on projects showing the best potential for growth and employment .
The second problem , which has remained unresolved and has serious repercussions on new states , is the calculation of on-call time .

Almost a billion illiterate people live in the developing world .
We must fulfil the objective set out in the Treaty of Lisbon : a social market economy that creates jobs that will leave prosperity and which will ensure a decent standard of living for all our citizens .

We would like to see an end to the times when the concept of stability was used as a means of negotiating , when the concept of stability was abused to gain concessions on human rights and the principles of democracy .

In my opinion , the Doha Round is crucial to international trade and may help greatly to reduce poverty in developing countries and to distribute the benefits of globalisation .
Unfortunately , these medicines are most often falsified and often contain no active substances except sugar and tobacco mix .
Greece will , of course , continue to use cohesion funds , because it is one of the countries that utilise these funds , and this is not related to the EU 2020 strategy .
Agnes Hankiss was accused of a private prosecutor , who allegedly committed a crime of public defamation and , in particular , a crime of defamation of the memory of the dead , of the defendants and fathers .

The creation of a European patent will stimulate innovation and scientific and technological developments in the European Union .
I would like to ask the Commission , the Commissioner and the European Parliament to examine carefully and denounce any practice within the territory of the European Union which may be misused for ethnic or racial discrimination .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the basic question , of course , is what we have to do now .
To talk about this matter is the role of the European Parliament .
in writing . - In 2008 , when I was a member of the Latvian Parliament , I tabled an amendment to the criminal law in Latvia , which aimed at tightening responsibility for domestic violence against women and children .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
In fact , I am convinced that the exemptions will not be used in practice , as there are safe alternative substances which will not only consumers but also professionals will be able to prefer in future .
Secondly , the health of harmful building materials such as asbestos must not , under any circumstances , be used further .
In other words , this debate arose on the basis of the need for security measures and , above all , on the need to draw conclusions from the investigation into the events in Detroit , as I just mentioned .
Finally , I would like to put particular emphasis on the development of marine routes and on the proposal made by Greece last summer to set up transport observers for the Eastern Mediterranean located in Greece .
Perhaps the European Union can learn from the two billion invested in the Chinese / African Development Fund in Africa .
The interpretation of the articles of the Treaty seems to depend on where the wind sees from .
I support this report , which will also allow Romania to gain access to funds which allow social inclusion for marginalised people , including the Roma , both in urban and rural areas .
I would like to stress that we are talking about international waters and Lene Espersen , the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs , have also made a strong statement about the inadmissibility of this negotiation .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
I had hoped that Parliament would approve the appointment of José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission for a further five-year period .
Council and Commission statements on a system of medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments .
At the same time , Libya has remained without health specialists , which the Bulgarians were mostly Bulgarians .
Instead of solidarity , the interests of large economic or financial companies and large powers always stand by them .
Both the Czech Government and the President of the Czech Republic have every right to say and do what they like , but they must not forget that they are part of the European Union and now speak on behalf of almost 500 million citizens and 27 Member States .
This results in financial difficulties , drastic reductions in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness , particularly for SMEs .
To conclude the report , we note that the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance is a meaningful and flexible mechanism for adapting financial assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries .
At the same time , we should introduce sanctions such as freezing bills and banning travel .
We are familiar with these methods , and our proposals are directed directly at preventing illegal advertising in many places .
Once again this year , Russia is in danger of interrupting gas supplies and there are indications that we will have to prepare for the threat of any future winter .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for the last minute to come to some compromises .
Mr President , I welcome President Barack Obama &apos;s decision to attend the EU-US Summit in Lisbon this month , and today I voted in favour of the resolution .
Administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political repression , executions - all these methods are incompatible with the obligations of the People &apos;s Republic of China as a member of the United Nations .
That is why it is unconvincing because this arrest is one of the hundreds of detainees being detained and is part of the systematic repression of all the signs of dissent .
This makes no sense .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current difficult economic and financial situation , Europe must continue to support projects in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector in the interests of a sustainable , social and competitive economy .
The debate on the single market and the Services Directive and how all this relates to patients &apos; rights were very interesting .
As regards the Tobin tax and the financial transaction tax , you are right : it is probably something different from Mr Tobin &apos;s initial vision .
I would also like to point out that I am pleased that Turkey is so close to the heart , and I mean my colleague Mr Madlenerova , the Dutch Party for Freedom .
As has been said in the Council &apos;s recent conclusions , human rights should always be dealt with at these high-level meetings and , if appropriate , will be part of these visits and also a meeting with a peaceful pro-democracy opposition .
However , the only thing that Kozloduy has set an example is how the old reactors can be safe and can work perfectly .
As regards the Danish Government &apos;s internal border controls plan , as Mrs Koppa mentioned , you will be aware that the President of the Commission wrote immediately to the Danish Prime Minister and pointed out that , according to the Commission &apos;s first analysis , there were substantial doubts as to whether the proposed measures in accordance with Denmark &apos;s obligations under European law and international law .
As guardian of the EU Treaty , the European Commission must ensure that all Member States comply with the provisions of the regulation and provide all the necessary information in time on the anticipated changes in the area of energy infrastructure .
This is a very clear signal from the European institutions that the citizens of Europe are opposed to brutal treatment and killing animals .
Mr Morel is doing good work as a special representative , but it is not enough .
When I recall what was said during the hearings that the members of the Court of Auditors also spoke , I remember they promised to work closely with Parliament .
The additional costs for many private companies and , of course , also for public transport systems will only lead to two things : an increase in the ticket prices for consumers and a reduction in services .
However , I see both light and drawn-out aspects in the reports .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
We do not want that .
I call on the rapporteur to table an oral amendment which will recognise the usefulness and effectiveness of the actors whose work is based on Christian faith .
( The sitting was closed at 11.00 )
It is not possible , for example , to consider seriously the possibility that the settling of female immigrants should be encouraged , particularly in a situation where it is not actually intended , whether it is a legal or illegal migrant .
We agree on the objectives , just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy .
In my opinion , during the discussions between the European Union and Russia on human rights , the question of whether the indigenous people of the Arctic region are sufficiently involved in the work of the Arctic Council should be asked .
In this decision , the Court has made a number of comments on ways to improve the inclusion procedure by the UN Committee on sanctions against al-Qaeda and the Taliban .
I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members who have been involved .
In the context of the economic situation in some countries , such as Greece , weakening the euro , the will and determination to maintain the permanent path towards a strong currency , as Mr Draghi shows , indispensable to ensuring the credibility of our economy .
Discrimination based on religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation has no place in European society .
The first is the need to reach a legally binding agreement .
We already looked at something similar yesterday when we adopted the regulation on hedge funds in the ECOFIN Council .
Welcome
I voted in favour of this report because money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will receive workers affected by collective redundancies .
As part of this policy , the EU must be able to respond to all possible sudden supply crises .
The aim of this assistance is to improve the living conditions of the people who receive aid by recommending and providing for all the instruments to ensure that these countries follow the path towards growth and individual responsibility .
That is why the solution is to achieve much more success in the future , and we will have the earliest opportunity during this year in Mexico .
That is a fact .
The blasphemy laws that introduce the death penalty are incompatible with the common values that we are trying to promote in relations with Pakistan .
I supported the European Parliament resolution , which calls on the Member States , among other things , to take action to help slow down the process of this disease among patients - such as encouraging healthy lifestyles and ensuring access to treatment for all patients - to create specialised centres , provide suitable medical equipment throughout the country and draw up strategic action plans for research in this area .
There is no stability without solidarity .
Since January , 23 000 immigrants have joined Italy .
Thanks to the Maltese Regulations , the Jesus Refugee Service and many Christian organisations recognise their commitment to resolving refugees .
The Stockholm Summit , which will take place next week , will therefore focus - as has already been said - on areas where there is mutual interest , such as the issue of climate change and energy , but also the global economic crisis .
Vice-President of the Commission . - In a world that is fast entering a new digital age , Europe must be equipped with broadband infrastructure technologies that really will be the engine of tomorrow .
Madam President , we have today voted on the review of the Green Paper on the future of the trans-European transport network ( TEN-T ) policy .
As a member of the STOA panel ( European Parliament Evaluation Institute for Scientific Technology and Technological Options ) project , I consider it very important that reliable statistical databases be drawn up .
Last but not least , I would like to mention the relationship between international trade and climate change .
in writing . - This report proposes various measures , some of which could help small businesses , but whose overall effect is to support EU control , population mixing , feminist agendas and infiltration of businesses by EU officials on track .
This exemption is proposed in order to tackle the crisis , which we have all seen clearly , which we have already debated many times .
The relationship between public finances and the financial and economic crisis is obvious .
During these 15 years , all 18 countries that have signed the United Nations Platform for Action on Gender Equality have made some progress in all 12 interest areas covered by this document .
EU enlargement strategy for the countries of the Western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey ( debate )
All the parties concerned should make use of the possibilities offered by the Geneva negotiations .
I know that EUR 9.5 billion remains uncovered in connection with the illegal trade in cigarettes smuggled to the European Union .
I also welcome the reference to the initiative of project bonds , which I consider to be a useful tool for growth and development in such a strategic sector as infrastructure .
Bulgaria and Romania have met the requirements and I congratulate Mr Coelho for bringing together freedom of movement with citizens &apos; security in his balanced report , which was adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We are deciding what should be done in this area , but let us remember that the fight against the economic crisis is at the heart of the financial support .
However , do you really think that it is these small businesses and their employees who think about the activities of the European Union ?
They came to Brussels to tell this Parliament that , if we adopt legislation on alternative investment in its proposed text , we will prepare this organisation by two thirds of its financial resources .
The key words will undoubtedly be &apos; added value &apos; , &apos; uniformity &apos; , &apos; flexibility &apos; and &apos; clarity &apos; .
There are , of course , other means of tackling the crisis , but I am sure that Commissioner Almunia will be willing to discuss this issue with you on the earliest possible occasions .
I am in favour of this report as forests which cover more than 42 % of the EU &apos;s area provide livelihoods for many workers and businesses in the forestry sector .
Unfortunately , we know full well that , under the leadership of the former head of John Major , the governments of the Member States have been deciding on the institutional headquarters , and that unfortunately , the 12 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg must be held .
At that time , the Committee considered that the fluorex should not be included in the ongoing evaluation process at European level , which concerned certain anorecals , due to its different mechanism .
We have always maintained the need for dialogue on reconciliation and for dialogue to continue .
It is reasonable , in fact , to first agree on a broader form of the European Union 2020 strategy and then to leave the budget review to the new Commission so that the new College of Commissioners has free hands in preparing this proposal and can work very closely with you on the financial perspective for the future .
Given the lack of a European policy to support shipbuilding , it is unlikely that the volume of production will return to the level before the current crisis .
There is no point in continuing to insist on the development of the Lisbon Strategy when the economic and social crisis that has been involved is getting worse .
If we allow the status quo to be maintained , there will be no rail freight here in 20 years &apos; time .
Furthermore , I should not neglect to stress the extensive negotiating powers that this proposal has demanded , particularly by the rapporteur , Mr Rangel .
As volcanic ash can result in the collapse of aircraft engines and may also exacerbate the visibility from window aircraft , the European Air Safety Organisation has taken a responsible approach and has set passenger safety as a top priority .
This is a legislative package which therefore mentions compliance with health and the environment with competition and innovation instead of pitting them against each other , as is often the case .
I am also very critical of the fact that producers should ensure voluntary collection .
The conclusion of this analysis is expected to be found in the next report on decent work to be carried out in 2011 .
I admit that it is not perfect and that there are comments .
Apart from the poverty we are unfortunately still struggling with , we are also concerned about global environmental issues , such as climate change , and we are currently basically talking about a kind of global premium whose objective is to offset the victims of the social and economic pain suffered as a result of the financial disaster .
Finally , I wish Commissioner Kovács every success in the future .
However , we do not support parts of the text relating to the increase in agricultural aid through the POSEI programme for EU producers affected by the agreement .
I believe that , following the introduction of these functions , European diplomacy should be able to play a more active and decisive role in the defence of the EU &apos;s fundamental interests , including energy security .
I would like to stress once again that the citizens of the EU are watching with interest how we will respond to the much-vaunted Lisbon Treaty .
We from the June List do not believe that the multiannual programme or the European Agency for linguistic Diversity and the study of languages at EU level should have something to do with around 500 million European citizens , apart from the additional burden on taxpayers .
However , this legitimate matter has , to a certain extent , become part of - let us say it without packaging - the perverse interinstitutional war that has been going on for years between the European Parliament and the Council .
You should accept that one of the reasons why the Commission is putting forward such ill-considered , unsuitable and under-processed proposals that we have to deal with in England and in other countries is the lack of transparency .
And who is to learn about this !
If we continue to argue that rail is the safest mode of transport and that , compared to the number of accidents on the roads , the number of rail accidents is very low for them - the bereaved families and severely injured - it is a weak consolation .
However , we also call for the upcoming EU-Canada Summit to address the problem of visa requirements , which the Canadian Government has partly reintroduced for EU citizens , which is for citizens from the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania .
The European Parliament also has a vital role to play .
It goes without saying that a new strict framework should apply to countries neighbouring the EU , of course , until we have once and for all managed to rid ourselves of the nightmare of nuclear power stations .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
Ladies and gentlemen , in accordance with the conditions of the European Parliament Act on the election of Representatives in general and direct elections , I declare the first session of the European Parliament opened .
I voted in favour of this report because economic stability can also lead to political stability in this area , which has been particularly worrying in recent years .
Further improvements to the text are the fact that Parliament has stressed the importance of educating legal professionals to cooperate and bring together our legal structures with one another , so that we can consolidate the tools for reaction , thereby making the European Union a real area of freedom , justice and security .
Why is it so difficult to say that the same should apply to the people of the Middle East ?
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , this debate is very timely at this particularly important moment for tourism , air transport and consumer protection .
I therefore support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals aimed at striking a balance between privacy and the security of individuals on the network , while fully respecting fundamental rights and freedoms .
We do , of course , have democracy here : we are therefore debating this issue , and it is a mere debate .
I am pleased that the European Parliament can finally enter Mekka and discuss future objectives that should be adopted in this regard .
The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funds more flexible ; it must do so now so so that the Roma can also draw on from them .
Furthermore , legitimate interests must be justified : national security , public security , prevention of violation of order or crime , health protection or truth , etc .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I represent the High Commissioner and represent the Commission .
We need to negotiate quickly , not only with regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - we will discuss this shortly - but also with regard to Iraq .
The ALDE Group is also very concerned that Russia imposed an unreasonable ban on imports of vegetables from the EU on the eve of the summit .
This instrument also shows that the burden caused by excessive regulation , which often shows a good name from the EU , is , in many cases , caused by any EU institution , but by the Member State itself .
This draft language law jeopardises the use of minority languages in every area of life , and concerns , for example , the half a million autochthonous Hungarian minority living there .
The dairy sector is currently in the midst of a crisis of unprecedented magnitude , with construction prices falling dramatically , and many EU farmers are struggling to survive .
We are pleased that the European Commission &apos;s proposal , headed by President Durăo Barroso , was rejected , with the aim of excluding &apos; self-employed &apos; workers from the Road Traffic Time Directive , based on our proposal for the Commission to be rejected .
In this context , the weak people in Europe , the political parties , the public and the European trade unions , claim that Eurobonds can play a key role in overcoming the debt crisis and ensuring the stability of the euro .
Now we should not reduce these ambitions .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Explanations of vote
Secondly , we would like to draw attention to the problem of non-tariff barriers .
Small and medium-sized enterprises are the driving force behind the European economy and sustainable development , and they also create a great deal of high-quality jobs .
Other actors , such as the appropriate emphasis on German as a working language , as laid down in the treaties , have been ignored .
The longer we are without agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme , the greater the risk of a terrorist attack which could otherwise be averted .
Mr President , this debate is recurring in Parliament .
This also means strengthening the education sector and investing in education , research and innovation as the cornerstones of a sustainable social market economy and one that takes greater account of the environment .
It is regrettable that the resolution comes much later than the statements by the Heads of State or Government of the United Nations to send tens of thousands of UN troops to that country .
As the EU is expanding further , the costs and the level of bureaucracy associated with the erroneous policy on multilingualism will only increase .
That has not happened yet .
All this may seem far from being possible , but if the brave military people in this Parliament can learn something about us , then that tyranny can never impose the salaries of liberty and that freedom on which they have an inalienable right is certainly regained one day .
We need to approach this situation with mutual solidarity and coordination , not &apos; everyone for himself &apos; , and we must not try to see each other in colour .
The three documents on broadband will follow on from the agenda : firstly , the communication on broadband , which sets out details of the implementation of the agenda in terms of broadband ; secondly , the recommendations on the new generation accession networks ( NA ) , which aim to clarify the basis and promote investment in high-speed Internet , and thirdly , the first radio spectrum policy programme , which will be the basis of the Commission &apos;s broadband strategy .
The objective of this directive is clear enough : we need greater cooperation among patients , and more cooperation among Member States to ensure it and , at the same time , help combat illegal trade in human organs .
During bank rescue , too little has been done to prevent this predictable development .
As far as production and employment are concerned , there are currently few examples in the goods manufacturing sector of a higher category , the manufacture of luxury goods and the high-tech sector .
It damages confidence when a government , in the summer , submits its banks to its stress test and realises in just a few months &apos; time that it was actually the euro stress test , not the banks .
I warmly welcome the adoption of this report because it deals with supporting research and innovation , which represents a driving force for the growth of the European Union today and in the future , thereby reflecting the common feelings of the people most affected : that it is necessary to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of the projects , while also strengthening scientific and technological assessment processes .
Membership of committees and delegations : see Minutes
I believe that it is the job of the political parties and of the parliamentary groups to oppose this popularity and demagoguery in order to make their opinion heard louder .
As far as the current crisis measures are concerned , I would like to draw attention to the fact that raising minimum subsidies from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 may cause problems for Member States which are in a more complex budgetary situation .
( The sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m. )
I would like to ask you if , in your concluding remarks , you could comment on some of these very real issues , so that people can realise that these are about them .
You have talked about five points , but the context - the idea that Europe 2020 will mean that attention is also focused on economic , social , environmental issues - is starting to be lost , or at least we have to say that this is a threat .
That is not my words .
As a result , the majority is now in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon , including the majority of citizens of your country .
So we have to be careful in this regard .
We should fight this , and we should support those who are penalised in this way .
I am sorry , but that is not possible .
I consider the restrictive measures and sanctions to be an important tool in European Union policy , both in terms of foreign and security policy and , of course , in matters of justice and the protection of fundamental human rights .
This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises , the cornerstone of our economy .
( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , but I would like to ask one important question about it .
We supported this resolution with a clear intention to send a signal that the European Parliament and its Labour MEPs are on the side of the Haitian people in the long term to resume the shameful infrastructure , community and people &apos;s lives .
We are clearly determined to maintain our support for the measures mentioned and to continue negotiating this issue in the European Union , not only with regard to preventing violence and helping victims , but also with regard to the areas of immigration , asylum and criminal justice .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Many EU Member States are complicit in Guantánamo because they have provided permits for flights over their territory for illegal transportation of prisoners , for example .
Under this programme , trade policy remains a very important tool which addresses the opportunities and challenges of globalisation and the promotion of economic growth , jobs and prosperity for all European citizens .
Let us therefore make it clear from our side that all obstacles need to be removed .
I would like to mention one more point , which is the entry of preparations from countries outside the European Union .
Unfortunately , one will realise , then , that for many decisions , the intention is to conceal the lack of responsibility that we have in our institutions , including responsibility for the adopted regulations .
I would like to add some important political aspects to this because , as has already been said , Tunisia is a society that practises pluralistic policy , although it is a limited quota for the opposition , yet it is a pluralistic policy .
We had a problem with the allocation of 18 additional Members of this Parliament , because some Member States did not actually count on the procedure , but we have decided that representativeness is the most important issue , that this is the principle we should follow and that this Parliament should have a balanced representation as soon as possible .
As has already been said here , sensitive land use , economic and social development in line with nature and enhanced cohesion within the European Union are also essential factors for disaster prevention .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and I look forward to making further progress on these relations .
The legal texts we are debating not only define the framework and explain the main principles , but the real , concrete measures that we have to take are yet to come .
Moreover , I think that we already need to go beyond the requirement for a greener internal market , for example , by promoting ecologically responsible procurement .
I refer to an important amendment , which stresses the way in which the issue of observers should be addressed , given that these observers are selected from the main candidates who have not been elected to the European Parliament .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s resolutions : see Minutes
We can talk about 2020 , but today we have a much more urgent problem : the euro area and Greece .
Information and communication technologies ( ICT ) are important sectors , not least for their influence in the European economy : they represent 7 % of the labour force - the European workforce - and 6 % of gross domestic product , which is to say , a significant proportion of the European economy , as well as the European manufacturing and labour forces .
I think we can expect a number of initiatives requesting the Commission to do more to have more Europe , and there is no doubt that the Commission will respond enthusiastically to such a request .
If we do not take our responsibility and adopt a clear position , then we can forget what the Toia epidemic said earlier : we must bear in mind that , in 2020 - and we have this in the digital programme - each European should be able to follow its interests using the opportunities offered by the radio spectrum .
Such organisations build their basis for power by responding to people &apos;s everyday needs and then consolidating their terror power .
Statements by the President
in writing . - I supported the Commission &apos;s radio spectrum policy programme because I believe all EU citizens should have access to faster broadband by 2020 .
The consequences of our unlimited use of its natural resources would be catastrophic , not only for surrounding areas and indigenous peoples , but for the whole world .
( RO ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mrs Győri on the mandate that is currently in charge , and I wish her and the Hungarian Presidency every success .
We also need to move forward with nanomaterials , and now that we have the section on cloning , we can continue to do so quickly .
The Package Partnership is particularly important in the areas of financial services , economic governance , implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy , energy and the internal market .
As far as the emerging countries - China , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia - are concerned , they are also making domestic commitments that go beyond what the scientific community is asking of them .
The protocol provides for the Union &apos;s contribution to São Tomé and Príncipe of EUR 682 500 per year to support São Tomé and Príncipe fisheries policy , which I consider appropriate .
We will see how it will be implemented in the future .
I also hope that the Council will take a more serious approach to Parliament &apos;s efforts in this regard , although I am very saddened and concerned about the fact that the Council representative is no longer here .
If we , as Europeans , are to play an active role in this regard , it is essential that we continue to do so .
This report is another step towards exerting pressure on the European Council , the Commission and the Member States to take measures to homelessness .
For example , in the event of expulsions , the family must be able to choose whether or stay where it is .
This appalling agreement was concluded under the banner and ratified in August in the 1980s .
Negotiations with Japan , which aim at strengthening trade relations , must not be used as a class weapon of big financial institutions and companies , promoting the growing exploitation of workers and people , eliminating their production forces and destroying the environment .
We confirm that we will fulfil what we have a duty to do and , in accordance with the pledges made in the Interinstitutional Agreement , we will keep the budget reform by the end of this year .
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo , between July and August , more than 500 people , including children , girls and women aged between 75 and 75 years old were victims of mass rape .
That is why the first draft report , which was based on the construction of a House of European History with huge operational costs , was in complete conflict with my firm conviction about budgetary self-restraint when using public finances .
After all , this is about investments which are not immediate and are being made in advance .
I also want to emphasise that we can give a helping hand to third countries , as the previous speaker has already said .
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential , although it concerns only 1 % of national health budgets , because in addition to figures , we should concentrate on the strength of this symbol , which is the legitimate right of every European citizen to be treated abroad , to obtain reimbursement while having all the correct information .
However , I call for the introduction of measures which , as part of primary prevention , will promote healthy lifestyles as a basic factor for improving health .
Given the diversity of legislation in the individual Member States and the often limited influence that it has on enforcement of the provisions of international law on combating violence , clear and binding regulations are needed on this matter at EU level .
What is your view on these unplanned obligations under the euro system ?
Freedom of expression and information , including the freedom to express opinions and freedom to receive and communicate information without interference and pressure , are the social values that many people have been fighting for for for for years , including in Portugal .
I believe that we can still save this planet .
We simply need , as we have said many times before , a sound , properly financed and present in all the regions of the European Union .
In principle , I share these concerns , and I believe that Turkmenistan still has a great deal to do before it is fully in line with international standards on democracy and human rights .
An increasing number of businesses are relocating , taking advantage of the cheaper labour price in a number of countries , particularly China and India , with damaging effects on countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Ladies and gentlemen - I am addressing the members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) in particular - there is no reason to defend one or the other group in Ukraine for party political reasons .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Mr President , the Arab world is our partner in the Mediterranean Union .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , with whom we share this programme , similar views , and , secondly , I would like to congratulate everyone involved in this report , because during the economic crisis , preserving such a programme of fundamental importance and presenting clear social benefits .
The Commission is looking forward to continuing to develop cooperation with this Parliament , including with regard to this issue .
Mr President , Commissioner , we must ensure that the promises made at the donors &apos; conference are now transformed into actual financial resources and actually penalised to the recipients to which they are intended .
It is this committee that forms a citizen-centred policy that is so necessary , particularly in the context of the crisis we are currently experiencing .
The European Council must ensure the necessary preparations , but it should not enter into any hasty conclusions .
If , in Portugal , several companies were not going bankrupt every week , so many Portuguese would not have been out of work and would have been in poverty .
We would guarantee that Member States subjected to reckless attacks by speculators could be supported without direct effect on taxpayers and could ensure that derogations are reduced .
From the new cases of breaches of Community law in 2007 , 1196 related to the failure to notify national measures relating to the transposition of Community directives .
I believe that a balance must be struck between protecting the environment and bureaucracy and the costs of industry and small-scale facilities , such as farmers and healthcare facilities .
The EIB is ready to contribute significantly to the implementation of the strategy .
( ES ) Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank my friend , Mrs Weber , for the excellent work she has done in this report .
I am pleased to see that Parliament and the Commission clearly have a consensus on many priorities in this area .
In fact , it puts international and national road transport in the hands of large monopolies .
- Report : Klaus-Heiner Lehne
If antibiotics are used on such a large scale , it is no wonder that there will be pathogen tribes which do not react to antibiotics .
This directive does not mention the principle of protecting migrant workers or those who are forced to work in unacceptable conditions and will announce it .
I am very pleased that we rejected the proposal , because it was only on the agenda for the Left to be able to attack its political opponents in Italy .
You are absolutely right .
It is true that a heated debate has been held in the Council on how best to ensure that the outlying Member States do not feel passionate and , finally , a qualified majority has been formed in the Council which , I hope , will be developed in Parliament , which I think , too , will come out of discussion .
Approval of Amendment 43 should not mean rejecting Amendment 54 , because Amendment 54 contains other issues which do not cover Amendment 43 .
Order of business
Climate change is not only an environmental problem we are facing , but it is also our duty to try to solve it in Copenhagen .
However , there is no need for a new authority to provide a framework or monitor the conditions .
- ( HU ) I welcome the Council &apos;s decision on the position to be presented at the G20 Summit .
We should consider whether we do not need new sources of income , and in this case we should focus on those who always benefited from this incredible situation .
in writing . - As passionate opponents of the European Union and its constant intrusion in our life , I am constantly voting against most of the reports I have been asked to carry out .
One million Britons lost their jobs for that reason .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is an instrument that the European Parliament is now increasingly using due to the complex stage at which the economic convergence of our continent is situated .
I ask that Judge Afiuni and all the prisoners in Venezuela be treated with dignity and that a fair trial be provided to them .
Several honourable Members have raised a question about the Gaza Strip as to whether I can assure them that the aid reaches across borders and that we continue to support people in this area , but we are trying to increase and improve this support through dialogue .
I voted in favour of this report as it calls for a more transparent , simpler and fairer system of funding for the European Union .
Although the European Union must maintain relations with the Russian Government , we must keep the warnings of this government that our request is always guaranteed by a democratic state and a democratic era , and that attempts to censor views which are not acceptable to the government or which will not put unreasonable pressure on the European Union .
( NL ) Mr President , unfortunately , in Copenhagen , the European community has not admitted to the municipalities - the United States , China , India and Brazil .
Mr President , honourable Members , I believe that research and innovation are essential if we want to have long-term solutions to protect our social model and the sustainability of our environment .
It is clear that the aim is to save raw materials by trying to obtain more attractive exchange rates .
You can test it .
Developing countries rightly point out that they did not cause the crisis .
In the light of these measures , the European Union should play its part by considering , at the appropriate time and appropriate form , perhaps technical measures which should complement UN sanctions and , at the same time , reaffirm its readiness for dialogue and dialogue , which should not even be lost in difficult times .
As the current directive does not seem to be sufficiently effective in discouraging late payments , I also support the tightening up of existing rules .
Since then , it is clear , above all , that the US has listened to European reservations much more openly and is more willing to seek a constructive solution than we had envisaged until now .
Commissioner Rehn , in fact , even said that , before the elections are held , the government must first approve the budget .
I would like to draw your attention to something which is rather strange : in the United States , the use of applauded in vans has been banned , but the European Medicines Agency has allowed it to do so , as most vaccines contain it .
The European Union &apos;s most effective instrument to combat unemployment is the European Social Fund , whose rules are now being made much simpler in order to speed up payments .
I think we must now leave enough time to be able to implement this package - the measures it sets out to see how it works and then decide whether there is a need for more .
New areas have been supplemented in order to strengthen cooperation : the fight against terrorism and organised crime , the prevention of arson activities , the fight against production , the accumulation of light weapons , and the trafficking of these weapons , cooperation on migration .
I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund is detrimental to the transparency of development policy .
The first is that , despite people &apos;s concerns and fears , we must not lose sight of our principles .
The resolution explicitly states and criticises the measures implemented by the current administrative body , but ignores the fact that the current mayor of Neapol , Mrs Iervolino , is a centre-left leader and , what is worse , neglects the long government of Mr Bassolino , which has been run by Naspol from 1993 to 2000 , the Governor of Campania , as well as the Special Commissioner for the year 2010 , and many cumbers of Campania .
Consider and fight for democracy once again .
In addition to what has already been said about the precautionary principle and the necessary traceability - which is very important - there is also the question of how it has been possible to publish , without proof or hardly any evidence , the general alert regarding Spanish cumber .
At this point , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the report is inadequate : it still imposes too many conditions for prior authorisation , making it difficult for Member States to do so .
The future of this region needs a firm , tolerant democracy that respects minorities and where the state is committed to everyone and is not abused by several individuals .
I really hope that Estonia will join the euro area on 1 January 2011 in order to create a space for economic growth and solve financial problems .
Therefore , the broad majority of stakeholders , including professional associations , agree with the possibility of patents only in English .
The only way forward for working men and women is through disobedience and failure to implement the decisions of the European Union and its institutions .
Furthermore , political dialogue has taken a deadlock .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am tabling an oral amendment to the vote on the following wording from paragraph 10 : &apos; Considering that the incorporation of this concept into the Protocol on additional standards of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and all forms of discrimination is not appropriate &apos; .
We need to increase and increase this goal , but only if the conditions are in place to do so .
It is imperative that the EU takes action by the IHNED .
As regards financial services , I can agree with the need for service providers to apply certain levels of transparency , but I have some doubts about the wording used in your proposal .
The budget on which this report is based , on which an explicit reference is made in the first recital of the compromise proposal , which agrees with the end of milk quotas , is unacceptable to us , which is why we voted against the report .
Madam President , these are indeed good news .
We are still doing our best to clarify everything we can .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to draw attention to the fact that I cannot make my contribution in Catalan , as it is not yet an official language , even though it is spoken by more than 10 million European citizens .
The Union must modernise its energy infrastructure and ensure that the energy infrastructure is interconnected between the individual Member States .
If Russia is unable to accept the political direction in which Ukraine is moving , it will have to move in spite of this , just as it has moved through the loss of political influence over the countries of the former Soviet bloc .
In this context , I would like to recall the decision adopted yesterday in plenary , in which we rejected the resolution on the case of Aminatou Haidar in order not to jeopardise the ongoing diplomatic proceedings .
Mr President , we are talking about the situation in Belarus , but let us not throw it at anyone else .
The main countries producing vehicles , supported by a majority of MEPs , who hear arguments from the car industry , have managed to prevent us from setting ambitious emission reduction targets .
We have worked hard together to compile this report , which I think is of a high quality and a clear vision on which Parliament wants the CAP to be heading after 2013 .
The example of the United States shows that flexibility is not considerable with uncertainty , but rather with a dynamic labour market .
As President of the European Commission , I confirm the principles set out in the resolution that you have just adopted .
To those who hold the future of this treaty , which is crucial to the Union , to our institutions and to the 500 million Europeans we represent , we must now send a clear message of responsibility .
These are all examples of the benefits of research using animals .
Documents received : see Minutes
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work , because even greater importance than the EUR 146 million that she has managed to act and which , as we believe , will have an enlightened effect , the symbolic value of this initiative .
I believe that Europe &apos;s cultural spirit is an important means of bringing Europeans closer together , in a way that fully respects their different cultural and linguistic identity .
I believe it is important to promote not only competitiveness in the agricultural sector , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farmers , organic farms and local distribution .
Special exemptions have also been allowed for remote rural areas and islands , such as Orknedo and Shetlanda , where long transportation times are unavoidable in my constituency .
The policies in force divide and disappoint our citizens , and the decision-making processes discourage them from participating , as the last European elections have shown .
As far as delays are concerned , you are right to start with this .
The resolution calls on the Commission to respond immediately to the legitimate complaint of a petitioner who has been facing this intolerable situation for 13 years and who has consequently lost a great deal of earnings ; at the same time , it calls on her to take the necessary measures to enable the petitioner to exercise his rights .
These objectives will be achieved through full support , effective implementation and a sufficient degree of compliance with existing legislation and instruments governing the protection of human rights and freedoms .
The European project has not yet been such a difficult test .
What are we going to do when the Americans , because it looks like , start selling their bunkedly trained cars on all four rounds and with high consumption in our market , which is already paid by poor quality vehicles for Turkey , India and China ?
Mr President , I would like to ask you how you evaluate the EU-Ukraine Summit that took place two weeks ago .
We are calling for global European solutions .
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out , if these points are to be clarified , the Commission should definitely consult the European Parliament when issuing the mandate .
It is very important that we , as Europeans , ensure that we send a European message and therefore also a hopeful prospect to Belarus .
The new European Neighbourhood Policy we are promising is more or less the same , with only a few backgrounds for democratic clarity .
It is clear that resolving the issue of illegal immigration and working is only partial and incomplete .
Let us be clear : we are all sending a clear signal to all the leaders with whom I think I can stand , and I do so with the support of this plenary and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States .
I will not override : one of the reports considers it essential that , in the event of a change of majority after the elections , the new government first has to obtain approval if it wanted to change the budgetary priorities of its predecessor , and even then it would only partially be possible .
Moreover , while our political differences remain , our interpersonal relations have clearly been enriched .
It is therefore important that we go further than the pilot project you have talked about , Commissioner .
In fact , nuclear energy is set up by the fact that each country has its nuclear safety regulator , which is fully responsible for implementing nuclear safety measures .
It is interesting , however , that , while it is true that many countries have problems due to the financial crisis , it is also true - and I think Mr Lamberts will recognise this and appreciate it - that , in most countries which constantly supervise public finances , there are unsocialist governments .
Various scenarios are possible , from the peaceful takeover of power to economic chaos and the outbreak of armed conflict , and even the use of nuclear weapons , cannot be excluded .
in writing . - ( DE ) In our ageing society , the number of cases of neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer &apos;s and Senate dementia , will continue to rise .
As far as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is concerned , and also the changes to the European Social Fund are concerned , I want to thank you for the excellent cooperation we have had , because the way in which dialogue has been conducted has been conducted , to the extent , been constructive , that we have the possibility of achieving the objective at this session , and I think this is extremely important .
What would we also encourage the Member States to begin , once they have applied for assistance from the EGF , by themselves implementing the measures that they have requested under the EGF , as this would at least ensure that workers do not have to wait for the application of the fund ?
These strategies and programmes cannot remain merely on paper , because they merely highlight irregularities and a lack of confidence in the legislation adopted by the European Union itself .
I do not know how well anyone could feel if they are showing a favour to this repressive regime by supporting the amendments that give Iran the opportunity to attack and celebrate opposition movements that have defended human rights and democracy in Iran .
in writing . - I voted against the introduction of EU contract law because I do not believe that Brussels should legislate where national legislation exists .
His election as President has brought hope and change , not only in the United States , but also throughout the world and in Europe .
I therefore support the proposals put forward by the Commission to the European Parliament , many of which concern my report on the Community Code on the rules governing cross-border movement of persons .
However , we object to the wording in paragraph 8 , which states that a gradual and rapid reduction in the tax burden on medium- to low-level salaries and pensions must be introduced through tax rebates , reduced tax rates and compensation for fiscal hindrance .
In many cases , when the government of the country in question has not been in the process of talks and programmes to improve the situation in question for a long time , the resolutions are all that the international community can do to counter these crimes .
We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the opinion of the new Parliament .
However , these exemptions should only apply if they are justified in terms of their importance in relation to security policy .
Mr President , they also called on the LTTE to lay down weapons , but unfortunately , this was rejected , even ignored .
I agree with the possibility of demanding structural reforms in countries with surpluses , but the main attention must be focused on deficit countries .
I would therefore ask that the roll-call vote be used for the second part of paragraph 12 .
However , I am pleased that Parliament has shown such a clear majority the determination to resolve the problem in the way we have decided now .
This is our European path and may differ from other paths .
This project , the European project of monitoring the consumption of veterinary antimicrobies ( ESVAC ) , was launched in the third quarter of 2009 .
Research plays a vital role in economic development and job creation , and it is therefore important to avoid excessive bureaucracy and unjustified delays that prevent scientific participation .
The banks are prosperous and still applauded when they show that they make a voluntary contribution to Greece .
This document shows that Member States are increasingly managing to implement EU legislation .
The best way to reduce population growth is to save young lives so that people do not feel the need to have greater families .
I therefore welcome the proposal , which lays down clear rules for identifying the aforementioned categories of products made from wine , so that high quality European production can always be recognised and specified .
The initiative will only be successful if it is easily workable and accessible to everyone .
In my opinion , the greatest attention must be paid to corridor 7 .
We therefore warmly welcome this communication , which shows new ambitions for Single Market policies and enables us to restore confidence in our social market model .
( The speaker agreed to answer a question from a different Member under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As you will be aware , the second round of presidential elections took place in Ukraine on Sunday .
The Hungarian Government should provide an effective guarantee for the freedom and pluralism of the media and repeal this law or substantially modify the comments and proposals of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe , the Council of the European Union and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights , and the European Union , through open , transparent discussions in which all stakeholders , NGOs and citizens can participate .
The Prüm Treaty has been imposed on European law without a proper democratic review .
My Liberal colleagues , particularly Mr Rohde , would like to reiterate once again that the reason for this support for free trade was its devastating consequences ; the fact that British bourgeois is governed by dishonest interests , because he considers it little important : Indian society had to destroy in order to speed up the start of the world revolution .
Ladies and gentlemen , Kenya acts in breach of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human Rights .
Firstly , civil protection is a responsibility of the Member States , and any coordination initiatives must be based on this principle .
In 2008 , the UN Special Rapporteur on Injudicial executions wrote that &apos; These murders were destroyed by leaders of civil society , including human rights defenders , trade unionists and defenders of agricultural reform , intimidated by many civil society leaders and restricted political debate in the country &apos; .
I do not agree with the last speaker because I think that , if the Treaty of Lisbon goes through , the possibility of bringing the EU even more meaningful to its citizens .
As far as civilisation and weapons are concerned , we are at the highest level than the Cold War , which is a distance away from pragmatic policies for demilitarisation .
Only then will we be able to argue that we will introduce genuinely functioning and effective economic governance for the benefit of all Member States .
I believe - and this is a good report that I will take with me , if this House will , I hope , follow us tomorrow with an equally large majority - that we have ensured that this monitoring actually works .
We also wanted to make it as clear as possible that we want public broadcasters not only to send high quality content , but also to introduce new platforms and take into account new technologies in their work .
Madam President , two years ago , in December 2008 , we had a problem in Ireland .
Although we cannot wait for miracles from this agreement , this is a step in the right direction , which is why I voted in favour of this report .
This is also an intergovernmental mechanism that the ECOFIN Council has established and requires unanimity .
This contradicts the real objective of regional aid , namely the strengthening of the weakest regions .
One symbol , one conclusion - that is what we should all work together on .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
However , the only option to fully develop our actions is the clear commitment of the Libyan authorities .
This , of course , sends out an important signal to future renewed institutions : Parliament , but also the Commission .
The fact that real criminals are in danger of adapting to profiling by using innocent persons as drug bearers or suicide assassinations or using other than trailers .
Another important element is greater access to schools , vocational and academic education and improved social conditions for women in rural areas .
Despite this , there are still other challenges .
Economic Partnership Agreements will not be sufficient unless they support regional integration and contribute to the development of ACP countries and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals .
In my opinion , the most important point in this regard is the need to agree a new budget for Europe and the European Union in the next few years .
In tackling challenges such as climate change and in finding ways of becoming increasingly demanding global competition , the EU must attach particular importance to research and innovation .
Europe is divided on this matter .
This is a good report and we must thank all those who are responsible for implementing this directive in the Member States and , in some cases , in the regions .
According to the UN , illegal logging accounts for 20-40 % of world timber production .
I know that they will leave us and , although we have agreed on several occasions , I think everybody will agree that a great deal has been done on this report .
This proposal , supported by the Council of Europe , has long been long awaited by all those who are campaigning for the right to include marginalised communities , particularly the Roma .
If this does not happen , then any law by this Parliament will be illegal , because Parliament will have 754 seats - three more than the Treaty .
Recently , however , we have discussed the Digital Agenda , on which we all agree , and this issue is very important for the digital agenda .
I would like to thank you for being truly joint in this debate .
Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with the Tribunal is a precondition for joining the EU , but the truth is that , yesterday evening , Commissioner Orban told me sincerely that there was no agreement in the Council about what that means .
The Arctic Council focuses on cooperation in the areas of the environment and research , but agreements aimed at using natural resources have led to the growing need to develop international administrative strategies where the EU could also play its part .
However , I strongly support a very strict position on access to the occupation of road transport operators .
When we opened up our markets to join the European Union , we paid the same amount to the budget and many other things .
Unfortunately , there is currently no European mechanism or institution capable of coordinating integrated continental renewal , which is why we are once again using various solutions that can fail as a whole , because the economies of the Member States are very interlinked .
I would just like to add that we are setting out a clear definition of price stability that enables everyone to assess what we do continuously in real time .
On the issue of the training of judges , the Council shares Parliament &apos;s view that there is a need to promote the development of EU judicial culture , by promoting direct exchanges between judges , public prosecutors and judicial employees of different Member States , and actively developing the European Judicial Education Network .
This is the direction we should take in our common efforts for the future .
However , that has not happened .
However , I would like to remind Parliament - and we have seen this recently in important cases in Greece - that even now there are cases of people persecuted for serious crimes of miscarriage and corruption in a Member State of the Union who disappear or are able to go unpunished and escape arrest by various procedural provisions and different national laws .
A general framework has also been created in which the various components can complement each other and strengthen each other .
Before the vote :
The Member States must be the most important report from our debate today that Romania and Bulgaria meet the same accession criteria as those expected by the European Union to join the Schengen area so far .
The existence of a pan-European contract law , which has been discussed for a long time within the institutions , may represent numerous benefits for businesses , consumers and for the smooth functioning of the internal market .
Politically , it is unacceptable for the report , which contains incorrect facts , to be voted on in plenary today ( 24 November 2009 ) .
On the one hand , we really cannot criticise the United States over the years linked to the Guantánamo centre and , on the other , do not show much will or desire to help them solve this problem .
That is why we voted against .
The phenomenon of emigration fuelled by the crisis and instability has negative consequences for the country of origin , the country targeted even by the displaced population themselves .
Madam President , I do not know what has happened , but I would like to speak as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ( ITRE ) .
As far as Serbia is concerned , persons residing in Kosovo and persons living abroad and are holders of the Serbian passport issued by the central authority in Belgrade will be excluded from visa liberalisation and will need visas .
Passengers will be able to choose between the reimbursement of the ticket price and the continuation of the same conditions and at no additional cost .
Rest assured that we have binding energy efficiency targets that really will be met .
I asked this question on behalf of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport and Tourism because MEPs were very concerned about the collapse of SkyEurope aircraft and called on me to take this initiative on their behalf .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
Firstly , we need to overcome the disparities arising from the growing value of life expectancy and the retirement age .
Proposals :
The debate is whether we believe that we can push through all the details in Mexico , including in the form of the agreement .
The OSCE quickly surprises the Council of Europe as the leading and most important forum for the negotiations on democracy - with ODIHR supporting the monitoring of the electoral process - human rights and legality in Europe .
This compromise is a good one , and I very much hope that there will be broad agreement in the vote tomorrow .
Not long ago , I have reminded Parliament that the elections in Belarus are not free , that there is no freedom of expression , association and opposition , and that they intensified repressive action by the authorities .
The claim should be scientifically substantiated , taking into account all available scientific data and after considering evidence .
This information is , of course , of paramount importance to both patients and healthcare workers , but it is precisely a defined framework that needs to be promoted .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , repeated accidents and the increase in the transport of hazardous goods by sea consistently raises urgent questions about strengthening security regulations governing all maritime operations in the European Union and the resources needed to enforce these rules .
The second matter is nuclear energy .
Then there will be a technical part which includes transforming the text into a legally binding treaty .
It is therefore important that the social clause in bilateral agreements becomes increasingly frequent .
Now we have a good opportunity to do so in practice .
Tuesday :
In order to improve this practical cooperation , the introduction of the Asylum Support Office was required by the 2008 European Pact and agreed in the Stockholm Programme in 2009 .
We celebrated this week on 8 March .
Madam President , I thank the honourable Member for that remark , but I would like to inform her that I am a representative of Poland , not Lithuania .
Mr President , I am pleased that the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this matter may ultimately be presented with the plenary , because a few weeks ago we had reason to question this .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs García Pérez , Mrs Jöns and Mr Angelak , who have submitted excellent reports , and all the Members who have spoken .
I know that many Members of this Parliament and the relevant national parliaments throughout Europe have watched these events .

We need to continue implementing economic , social and territorial cohesion policy in order to reduce disparities between regions and create a basis for balanced economic growth , as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The vote will take place subsequently .
The groups on human rights have accused Google of helping the Chinese Government oppress its citizens and , in particular , human rights defenders .
This is what the proposed directive is about to change quickly and prepare it for implementation as soon as possible .
In this situation , I propose , as I have done in the past , that the Eastern Neighbourhood Assembly be established , Euroeast , with the participation of the European Parliament , based on the principles of the Euromed and Eurolat Assembly , which would aim to implement ENPI in the countries of Eastern Europe .
The most important thing we need to discuss is funding the European budget and the future financial perspective .
We must inform our citizens of its importance and how they can use the tools we provide to them with this directive so that they do not fall victim to the danger posed by the purchase of falsified medicines .

( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Espinosa , Commissioner , the Spanish Presidency has decided to prepare an assessment of the Copenhagen climate change conference , while , according to a number of Members who have spoken here , the conference has ended in a fiasco .

Commissioner , you quoted the Lisbon Strategy , innovation , the green economy , and you know that this European strategy is a failure .
No , it intends to continue to pay export refunds .
( DE ) Madam President , in the case of any country , it is necessary to consider its beginnings and whether developments with regard to human rights and minority rights are along the right lines .
Furthermore , it is essential that the fishing companies be legislatively encouraged to use such gear , which are currently best possible in terms of selectivity , and that they do not carry out such a massive amount of subtle fish and other than targeted species or discards .
We will continue to exert pressure in this direction .
For many years , as the Commissioner rightly pointed out , our main competitors have been indicating the countries of origin of the goods they enter their territory .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , 20 May , at 12 noon .
While the EU supports the Copenhagen proposals to eliminate the industry in the West and to ensure domination of the Third World , ordinary people regard climate change as a pretext to impose additional taxes on us , control us and introduce internationalist dogmas and global governance at the expense of the national state .
Moreover , we are in constant contact with third countries , particularly with Russia , and we ask them to abolish the import ban , which we consider to be disproportionate .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner Hahn , the proposals that are now on the table are like us to put a great deal of battles on the back of all those for whom the situation is so difficult to tell them that they have to run up with it more quickly .
I once again express my great appreciation for their courage and determination .
At the same time , it is clear that in the next few years , the consequences of the irresponsible budgetary policy which some Member States have been pursuing so far .
The first is that science is a global envelope and the progress we can share towards increasing the overall efforts of humanity .
I would say : no more rules .
Romania &apos;s government &apos;s letter is deteriorating sharply , and has contributed too much to the drastic measures for living standards of citizens , and is therefore resorting to the increasingly violent anti-democratic methods of power .
Let us accept the utopia , the opia of peace !
We believe that the European Union remains on the right track and , through controls and transparency , we want to ensure that the 20 % target is achieved and that nothing is shown in Europe .
It also proposes more funding for projects in this area , particularly in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development , the EU public health programme , youth and nationality programmes and the lifelong learning programme .
In view of the fact that there are only seven members of the committee and that their role is very responsible , it is important that they are completely pointless and very competent .

Following last year &apos;s public consultation , the Commission is carrying out an assessment of the comments on collective redress issue and intends to find solutions which meet the needs of European consumers without , at the same time , importing the methods used in the United States .
Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens and the best kind of active dialogue with European citizens is a dialogue based on listening to what the citizens say in democratic elections .
I think that the debate we are having here this evening has shown an extraordinary consensus on the part of this Parliament , for example , on the appointment of an EU Special coordinator for Tibet .
I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States as well as all other EU citizens .
This is an excellent example , and a benchmark has given us a lesson from the other poorest countries of the planet : once they have entered the buildings , we have seen a slogan &apos; without justice is not peace &apos; .
In this context , cooperation between the Union and the Council is vital to safeguard energy needs and to prevent an increase in oil prices on the world market .
If we fail to give a clear response to these questions , these two objectives will affect employment growth and reducing poverty levels as much as the Lisbon Agenda .
- Before the vote :
Mr Amado said , &apos; I did not talk about the smooth functioning of the European institutions &apos; .
I hope that 2010 , too , will be a very good year for Croatia and the countries of the Western Balkans , but I would also like to emphasise the need to consider the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons and to deal with them accordingly .
I know that this is not easy .
Madam President , I would like to join in the calls for this proposal to be withdrawn and for the Commission to present a new proposal based on a different legal basis .
There are numerous review clauses which have been incorporated into operation , but I agree with what Diana Wallis says that the key to this compromise were the exceptions .
The Commission &apos;s position is commendable : it imposes on Member States the responsibility for the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste they produce , including its storage , in the form of drawing up their own programmes .
I believe that this text represents another instrument that the EU can use , because it proposes a coherent and effective policy on migration flows , which aims to restore its actions to the most direct conditions of political , economic and social stability .
Mr President , thank you all for the speeches of support and comments , by the way , including those who oppose the report .
Our third objective was to simplify and facilitate the SME sector &apos;s access to financing instruments .

on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is more of a border with political provocation when this Europe 2020 programme is presented as a wonderful strategy to help us emerge from the crisis .
We have decided on five objectives , one of which is social inclusion ; that is the competence of the European Union under the Treaty .
We have recently seen the importance of a problem that we are debating with the approved legislation when several million households throughout the European Union exchanged their CRT TV televisions for LCD .
We need to invest in neighbouring countries , particularly those in the east of the EU and offer them the necessary incentives so that they can continue with their reforms and we need to be able to strengthen the EU &apos;s presence in the area .
Given the increasing number of appliances produced and their effects on health and the environment , if not properly processed at the end of their life , it is important that the most effective criteria are laid down .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the issue of information on medicinal products available is a sensitive issue , as it has a significant impact on the health and welfare of all citizens .
Mr Barroso , President of the European Commission , is responsible for the current situation of the financial , economic , food and environmental crisis into which Europe has plunged .
In particular , I would like to thank Mario Martens , who has produced an excellent progress report on the adoption of the EU-Africa strategy .
Let us not forget the need to ensure the quality of products sold in Europe and the safety of their users .
These conclusions highlight that we must learn from the disaster in Japan and that we must review the safety conditions of nuclear power plants in the EU and carry out stress tests .
This report takes a wide-ranging approach to the issue of forest management , focusing on some issues that we consider to be important .
The Commissioner said this was provided for in connection with the Geneva Agreement ; but let us not forget that the rate is EUR 114 .
It is clear that the governments of Serbia and Macedonia will have to participate in most of the tasks and , as Mrs Malmström said , it is the ones who have to inform their citizens .
Given the difficult situation in the market and the commencement of discussions on the future of the EU &apos;s agricultural policy , Parliament must make a clear commitment to the necessary security of all areas of agricultural production to enable them to plan their future .
What measures does it intend to take with regard to the &apos; activities &apos; of credit rating agencies ?
It is worth mentioning the fact that volunteering undoubtedly has a positive impact on developing the European identity , whose roots derive from these values , and that it constitutes a good basis for developing understanding between citizens from various social groups and countries across European society .
Ladies and gentlemen , the proposal to amend the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is one of the most important measures both for improving the quality of life of European citizens and for supporting the economic recovery adopted by Parliament .
Belgium has received a promise from the previous Presidency that Parliament will be involved in the debate on this multiannual financial framework .
In some cases , spectrum is an appropriate tool for new participants , but it is necessary to prevent unnecessary procedures , so there would be agreement between us .
Nobody would understand that , but if these amendments were adopted , the result of the proposal would be exactly the opposite .

I would like to hear from the Commission whether this will be included in the amended text of the communication and whether the obligations will be imposed properly , specifically by the Member States , although these obligations will be supplemented by services of general interest , which should be drafted on the basis of consultation with the European Parliament and the Council .

That is why I voted for the report on the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions .
It is important to manage this , and the European Parliament resolution that has been approved today contributes to it .
The Commission will be based on the work of the European Institute for Gender Equality , which will collect and analyse data and statistical data on this issue .
In addition , these measures would damage Union foreign trade policy as it would make it difficult to conclude future free trade agreements , whether they be bilateral or multilateral .

To be honest , I find it surprising that we are now in a situation where we need to use almost defensive arguments , because this issue cannot be considered solely on the basis of the Euratom Regulation , but must also take into account the protection of consumers , the protection of the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants , based on the rules of the European Treaty , to ensure full control and end .
Finally , European energy security is about close cooperation with NATO .
We think that the European Union and the European Commission should place greater emphasis on the values that can lead us to the objective of common peace and security .

The financing of land ownership in developing countries must be seen as the EIB &apos;s investment costs to external credit .

However , this cannot be left for the decision of all euro area Member States .
We demand that assisting spouses be made mandatory , as well as self-employed workers .
Moreover , given that the government has lost its access to the financial markets , not providing assistance would have meant that fiscal policy would have been even more restrictive than that , and the reduction in expenditure would have been even stricter .
To give the example of these dogmas , for example , the recent article Václav Klaus , where he will advise him to overcome this financial crisis by temporarily weakening social , environmental and health standards , because these standards are said to hinder rational human actions .
As part of the discussions under way , it is important to establish clear guidelines and defend them , including on behalf of Austria .

In terms of budget controls , which cover in parallel terms of the real results and performance of European programmes and institutions , the EIB undoubtedly deserves a high assessment , particularly in terms of political friendliness .
This is a difficult task , but I am sure you will do your best to achieve it .
I am not the only person who would like to hear an explanation of this matter .
We have also followed with deep concern the reports on the detention of several Tibetan students and teachers who demonstrated peacefully in protest against the government &apos;s educational reform plan .

( PL ) Mr President , the European Parliament has adopted a resolution many times to condemn cases of breaches of human rights and freedoms in various parts of the world .
As you know , the diplomatic impact of the conflict in Gaza has been very serious in the whole region : the indirect dialogue between Syria and Israel has been postponed ; Mauretáia and Katar have interrupted ties with Israel ; the escalation of Arab peace initiatives has been threatened .
Firstly , we are talking about a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights , which is not an institution of the European Union , but is part of the concentrated circles of the European Union , but is independent - that has a duty to the rule of law , representative democracy and human rights .
We can help the markets to new technologies , such as clean and energy-efficient vehicles , and help with harmonised standards for the widespread introduction of new technologies on the market .

This instrument will facilitate economic , technical , academic , financial and cultural cooperation , thereby benefiting the European Union and its partners .
Climate change , as I have said many times before , is an urgent and serious issue and requires targeted and effective instruments .
The European Union must now move forward and concentrate on real work , on building dynamic , competitive economies and on creating a strong global trading system over the coming weeks , specifically to ensure a truly effective agreement on combating climate change .
At the moment , a united Europe without wars or the European Parliament has to look like a pure fantasy .
There are , however , certain aspects , but there are aspects that are less visible than others , and which have not yet been sufficiently developed .
In any case , I intend to announce to the next college - both the President and the Members - that I and the other Members will address this matter until the very end , because we must persuade and move our producers to meet high standards .
However , the main obstacle lies in something else : unless there is a clear political nature for the European project , we will be able to tackle our problems .
I fully agree that the debate on territorial cohesion should be combined with the debate on the future of EU cohesion policy , given that the reform of this policy must take into account the conclusions of the first discussions .
If our Member States can invest less in education , training , research and innovation , let us do so by pooling our resources at European level and making economies of a scale .

Let me reiterate that the political commitments of the Euro Plus Pact go beyond all the other measures in the package with a view to improving Member States &apos; economic performance : stricter financial supervision under the Stability and Growth Pact , new macro-economic surveillance and the implementation of structural reforms to achieve economic growth within the vital EU 2020 strategy .

Similar situations are also in place in Bumgarten .
If they are properly regulated , they can actually make a difference .
Two aspects are highlighted .
I voted in favour of the report on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security because it presents important proposals on how the common agricultural policy should respond after 2013 to the challenges related , including food security , climate change , the economic crisis and the affirmation of territorial balance within the EU .
Following the change in the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation so that these documents include the creation of the European External Action Service , there is now a need to approve a budget for its proper functioning .

Only subject C , which is selling final goods to consumers , will pay VAT .
Finally , there is the terrible security situation in the Darfur region and the government &apos;s unilateral desire to hold a referendum on its status on 1 July 2011 .
Such a system takes much greater account of the differences between the individual Member States with regard to market and mentality .
Mrs Rapti , I have given you a little more time , because the birth rate always takes a little longer .
In these circumstances , if , on all sides of this Parliament , we want to intervene to defend what we call the democratic values of the European Union , we need to express silent warnings and , Commissioner , we need to enforce European law as you have said , together with the thousands of Italian intellectuals , creators and journalists , we need to say that freedom and freedom to be informed unconditionally in Italy as well as throughout the European Union .
That is why they have managed , through this long and lengthy procedure , either to remove all the positive provisions for monitoring the security of ships or to postpone them to a football .
The Swedish Presidency has faced the economic crisis and the financial slavery with appropriate and realistic measures .

However , we all too much emphasise the role of the Member States and very little what is behind a certain market activity .
When negotiating and planning climate change policies , we will have to link the Council &apos;s environmental leadership with greater capacity for external action .
I hope that Member States , particularly Italy , will implement this legislation very quickly .
If you want to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure , you will have the opportunity to do so at the end of the debate .
The data transmitted must only be used within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to third countries .
The next item is the report by Mr Karma , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
I therefore believe that the conclusions of the rapporteur in the decision - which should take into account the interests of the outermost regions - are very relevant , so Parliament should give its consent , provided that the Commission and the Council : Parliament will submit an assessment of the impact of the agreements on banana production in developing countries and remote regions as soon as possible ; they will introduce concrete measures aimed at strengthening the trading position of banana producers and will take measures to help banana-producing countries .
A key factor in achieving this is for developed countries to be willing to open up their markets to developing countries , including India .
I am very grateful for the fact that Mr Daul and others have managed to establish a package that has received the support of the overwhelming majority of the committee &apos;s members .
There must be one objective for the Europe 2020 strategy : one young person must have a job .
Diverging levels of development and the growing inequality of opportunities and the division of resources from a geographical , social and generational point of view ( which are partly in touch with people &apos;s conscience ) , and the resulting increase in the number of natural disasters , the increasingly pollution of the environment , the unbalanced human pressure concentrated in large urban areas and the equally unbalanced increase in the number of people in certain areas of the planet , which are the causes of basic disasters and the rehabilitation of basic human disasters .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my thanks already to all my fellow Members who worked with me on this issue - thanks to this , a common position could be found between all the political groups in Parliament and the oral question and the drafting of an oral resolution on the voluntary partnership agreements .

The creation of a common legal framework is a prerequisite for the rapid development of these infrastructures .
The President told me that these are internal matters and the European Union cannot interfere in internal affairs .
The European Union should take a stronger position in this case .
The possible deficit of this fund is a matter for the fund and its members , not a European taxpayer .
The reason why the Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal is because this premium is only paid out in Denmark , Sweden and Slovenia , where the bullfighting is not taking place , as we know .
I would just like to respond to Mrs Doyle &apos;s speech .
All this requires conviction , time and , above all , political courage , which we are lacking .
This is a non-binding measure in the proposal put forward by the Commission about 10 days ago : in other words , instead of the Commission building a specific aspect of the single market , it is destroying it .
For these two reasons , I think we should be very careful not about where the money comes from , but where it goes .
Above all , we have to acknowledge that , by adopting last June , the implementation plan that was presented a few weeks ago , Vice-President Tajani gave a new European tourism policy , as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon , very strong support .
I am also in favour of &apos; greater &apos; budget assistance , whether general or specific , and less projects , at any time it will allow macro-economic and institutional criteria .

I hope that , if the Swedish Presidency persists , we will achieve success at the Copenhagen Summit .

The Commission &apos;s main objective within the framework of competition policy is to enable the companies involved to benefit from the security zone by adopting a block exemption regulation designed to ensure proper market surveillance .
Madam President , the Spring Summit is supposed to be an energy summit .
Citizens expect the law to apply indiscriminately to everyone .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that these upgrades to free trade agreements between the European Union and Egypt can contribute to economic and political stability in this key area , with a view to consolidating a single area of peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
This report seeks to contribute to a new energy action plan under the Europe 2020 strategy .
And Mrs Ţicău &apos;s question ?
Europe must make greater commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals ; in other words , it must devote at least 0.7 % of GDP to combating poverty in developing countries by 2015 .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that both reports focus primarily on the partnership principle .
It is clear to be opposed to talking about the Copenhagen criteria , about other types of legislation , but it is probably not interesting or if it is not so brave as to cover behind a lack of power to go beyond , let us say , the protection of minority groups , because ultimately we are faced with an eternal dilemma .
Many of them are detected or reported belatedly , which jeopardises the protection and proper use of taxpayers &apos; money .
The Swedish Presidency of the EU and the Commission must be thanked for their work on activating the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection .
I want to encourage the European Commission to take the necessary measures to strengthen controls , which is an integral part of European consumer security policy .
Exempt Padania !

Livestock farmers are not in contact with end consumers , but are treated by processors who are always allowed to import .
Nobody is entirely satisfied , but I personally see the appointment of both representatives as a positive balance has been found between everyone &apos;s interests : big and small states , between men and women , between political spectrum pages .
Mr President , Islamic terrorism is currently dominated by terrorism .
All participants can and must learn lessons in order to avoid such situations in the future .
( PL ) Madam President , we all know that diamonds can be bleed , but also delays .
This European Parliament resolution therefore devotes the greatest attention to creating new jobs and combating social exclusion .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the fact we all agree on is that this programme of harmonising frequencies and the coordinated use of radio spectrum can serve a dual purpose .
The reason for this is that wars still exist in the world ; at present , there are 4 million refugees and displaced persons from Iraq , and it is clear that these people have become refugees as a result of wars in which our countries have also initially been involved .
Can I ask you , Madam President , to write to the Czech and upcoming Swedish Presidencies the official call for formal dialogue with the European Parliament to be launched shortly ?
Faced with this fact , a European voice must demand support for the adoption of commitments to official development aid , which will also require new sources of additional funding to help these countries , reduced fees and taxes on emigrants , which will appeal to our resilience to protectionist efforts and support further Doha Round negotiations , and which will trigger tax evasion and debt .
Some argue that labelling is costly , but a number of products are already being labelled , so additional costs will be minimal .

Consequently , it could serve precisely this objective to serve the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to create an EU Operational Headquarters by completing the existing NATO command structure in the area of joint civilian and military operations .
However , we should not forget the jobs affected by the decision we are discussing today .
in writing . - The new rules approved today by the European Parliament will indeed support consumer rights throughout Europe .

I have voluntarily offered to represent Stavros in this very important debate .
A potential and very important resource could be for the Central and Baltic States to use the emission credits collected under the Kyoto Protocol , thereby gaining benefits from the climatic resources of these countries .
Thank you .
in writing . - ( RO ) I supported the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , the approach adopted in the Commission communication entitled &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; , as well as the idea of an annual Single Market Forum .
However , like my fellow Members , I find it regrettable that the Council calls into question Parliament &apos;s new codecision powers in the light of long-term management plans .
I voted in favour of this report .
- Report : Paolo Costa
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to express my disappointment that , four years later , we have still not received a proposal from the Commission about how we can tighten up animal transport legislation .
This report is the result of a compromise , as it has been submitted to 1 625 amendments , and it is divided into a number of key points that cover the causes of the crisis , from bubles to non-banking products , to a lack of tax harmonisation in Europe and to a lack of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact .

I would like to use style which reflects what is positive with regard to the European Union , because , although it may seem surprising , there have also been positive events recently .

( The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Ladies and gentlemen , I think what took place in the Committee of the Regions was a serious and detrimental violation of the rights of a Member State of the European Union .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am somewhat shocked that my fellow Members , who otherwise always talk about simplification for small and medium-sized enterprises , have reason to say no more than a first positive move towards micro-entities - and I want to stress that they are the subject of today &apos;s debate - are a reason to make any simplifications .
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to help manage this waste , which is intended to allow this waste to be hazardous , and the adoption of a more demanding and preventable regulation .
Our objective should be a complete transition to renewable energy by 2050 .
We need absolutely proper implementation of the existing regulations , and I think your comments about navigation , etc . are useful in this debate .
In another place , it is said that Europe has an ageing population .
I believe that Parliament is , by definition , obliged to work towards us in response to the problems that are proving to be a more dynamic solution in Europe , bearing in mind transparency in the management of funds .
It is also completely absurd and unacceptable for MEPs to ask the Commission for the content of the agreements on which we are to vote .
I would also like to highlight the mutual positive action between public and private actions which , on the one hand , help in handling damages , and which has set a five-year period of action .
I join in the positive assessment of the rapporteur &apos;s consolidation of financial and human resources management and improving the functionality and effectiveness of the internal control functions achieved in 2008 .

In the Europe we dream about , freedom of expression is a fundamental value .
( DE ) Mr President , all the countries that are undergoing the crisis are facing real problems .
We would like to call on the Council to stop ridiculing this House and to stop being ridiculous with ourselves as well .
For this reason , I and my group supported this directive , as it represents an important step by Parliament - a move that will have a positive effect on the lives of European citizens .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive on consumer rights tabled by the Commission is worth bringing together four previous directives on this subject in one legislative instrument .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , particularly Mr Sánchez Preseda , for the Social Democrats and Mrs Bowles , who have worked successfully with me on the compromise text that we have presented today as a report on the Commission &apos;s White Paper .
( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , the extent to which this debate is of interest is interested is clear from the fact that no one in the Chamber is in any more , so that they can hear what Mrs Ihirs Vaidere has just said - that Russia &apos;s visa policy is being used , not to strengthen the naturalism process in Latvia , but to achieve another .
However , I think that the work we have done gives us cause for optimism .
In my opinion , the EU should assess this carefully during the upcoming dialogue , mediated by the High Representative .
( DE ) Mr President , in this debate , unresolved questions relating to European economic policy are addressed .
In addition , the Commission &apos;s strategy for monitoring research is designed to provide adequate insurance for the legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis for a duration of the framework programme .

( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , every year , thousands of children fall victim to child trafficking , and even more kidnapped .
Good governance and regional policy of the EU (
We should not forget that GDP is a measure of production and is not a benchmark , for example , environmental sustainability .
In such cooperation , the life of the rapporteur is much simpler .
It is therefore absolutely crucial from a political point of view that we vote in favour of this document , and this turnover by Mrs Wallis , as well as some of Parliament , is completely unjustifiable in view of the discussions that have taken place .
Moreover , this opinion supports both the study prepared by the Swiss Institute on Compariss and the Schaldemose report approved by Parliament in 2009 .
( NL ) I shall begin by saying to Mr Bowis for his very energetic and diligent efforts in the interests of public health and patient mobility , and I should like to wish him a speedy recovery .
The problems that have occurred in recent days in Europe &apos;s air transport have once again demonstrated the fundamental role of passenger and freight transport in the organisation of current society .

Moreover , they demonstrated their opposition to certain policies in the communication to a significant number of governments , for example , with the aim of reducing taxes .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the package we will be voting on tomorrow would be nothing without the will of the European Parliament , and I would like to take this opportunity to applaud the work that has been done .

Let me take this opportunity , Madam President , honourable Members , to thank you for your special support for the EUR 10 million which Parliament approved for the European Refugee Fund at the end of 2008 .

They are disheartened and concerned about the possibility that they might be excluded from the labour market .

the report by Mr Grech , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on the creation of a single market for consumers and citizens ,
A realistic measure must be established to increase employment , especially the employability of young people .
I think there is one good thing here : that we are all interested in research and we know that it is the only hope for Europe and the Member States .
I would like to say that it was a mistake that the Presidency did not condemn the article published in the Swedish newspapers .
We need measures to obtain control over late payment in commercial transactions in order to protect the health situation of the European economy and avoid situations where production structures are financially built and overfunded , thereby increasing dependency on the banking sector .
It is nonsensical to support imports of products which do not even meet the quality criteria imposed on our farmers .
Finally , we have major challenges ahead of us , namely , ensuring unity at European level , strategically collaborating with key foreign partners and maintaining full commitment to multilateral climate measures , but we can learn a great deal from the 15th Conference of the Parties on Climate Change of COP 15 .
It should therefore be based on real problems , asking ourselves important questions and concentrate on concrete measures which will bring added value to citizens &apos; everyday lives .
Oral questions and written declarations ( tabling ) : see Minutes
Opening of the session
I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for his very constructive approach .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s amendment which in some way protects bees , which are crucial for farmers and food stocks through pollination .
In this way , we can encourage users to choose cleaner vehicles or modes of transport in the long term , to use less of the infrastructure or travel in a different way .
We are tackling the security problems with Iran &apos;s attitude and the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan .
I think it is important that we enter into the negotiations with the aim that the best solution is a solution involving a shared commitment on all sides .
We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at a low level .
On the other hand , other states , for reasons which seem to be reflecting their own blatant interests on applicants , have chosen to use the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of the Schengen area to attempt to prevent them again .
in writing . - ( FR ) I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on this text which will allow slots to be freezed for the summer season .
We therefore need to analyse , for example , what happened in Detroit in order to try to prevent mistakes , but we must not react deliberately after any attack , because this would probably result in measures being taken that , in some cases , simply make no sense .
Any work of the &apos; full-time mother &apos; must be at least evaluated for the purposes of social insurance contributions .
There will no longer be room for further fraudulent and unjustified political attacks .
In this respect , Europe &apos;s approach could look like &apos; yes &apos; , of course , we need security of supply and large-scale projects such as Desertec , but we also need to ensure that companies , businesses and individual households can have greater control over energy budgets and energy consumption as regards prices , efficiency and the environment &apos; .
For this reason , the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the proposal calling for an impact assessment and will vote in favour of Mr Sturdy &apos;s amendments - which I personally signed - relating to substances that deplete the endocrine system and to support the use of plant protection products in case of emergency .
It is outrageous that others should pay for the mistakes of the same honestly working countries once again .
Europe has , at the time , made an important commitment in this region : EUR 1 billion in Afghanistan , EUR 300 million in Pakistan , the EUPOL mission , which , despite problems with the number of personnel , the international observation missions , and naturally also the participation of individual states in the ISAF mission .
That is one thing .
Another necessary measure is for India to create and apply transparent and comprehensible public procurement legislation which will provide European companies with access to these contracts .
Thus , when carrying out proper impact assessments and outlining various legal alternatives , along with a clear definition of the objectives and funding of European infrastructure , it will be easier to bring the long-term strategic projects to build a stronger EU by the end .
Part of this process is the ratification of the new START Treaty , which is still awaiting negotiation in the United States Congress .
It is becoming increasingly mobile and , according to a recent risk analysis , organised crime is increasingly involved in cyberspace crime .
I am also of the opinion , as has already been said , that we have clearly identified what comfortable criticism is , namely with regard to group supervision .
I am committed to working with this President of the European Council , because this partnership will be extremely important .
On the other hand , however , the report creates the conditions for the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers sent to consular authorities and international organisations which will be responsible for preventing illegal immigration and mediating illegal immigrants from returning to their country .
Now people can rightly say that the Brandenburg gavel has become a gateway of freedom .
First and foremost , this communication provides for how good tax governance can be improved within the European Union to support the argument why other jurisdictions should also be involved .
At the beginning of this speech , I spoke about the difficult choice , and the Commission knows which routes it wants to take .
However , it is clear that , if the two main parties in the country remain stubborn , then this objective will never be achieved .
I believe that your contribution is becoming increasingly important in the context of the current situation where Member States are forced to take a difficult decision , but I believe that it is essential to protect research and innovation as an investment in the future , and I can assure you that I will inform the Council of the content of this debate and remain available to you .
We should be sufficiently humble and recognise the right to democracy and the highest power of parliament in all 27 Member States .
I also believe that we must proceed with a policy of zero tolerance for human rights and democratisation , and that we must demand very high standards .
( RO ) Mr President , this regulation is a step forward in meeting the CO2 emission reduction targets for light commercial vehicles in Europe gradually .
One might say that this transport strategy is at the forefront of the major strategic development plans in Europe .
Those groups that are most vulnerable to unethical practices , such as children , young people and elderly people , should receive special protection .
Despite these reservations , I welcome the micro-credit service in Poland with open arms .
It is the duty of the Egyptian authorities to take urgent measures to stop torture , investigate all cases of violence in peaceful protestors and stop prosecuting civilians before military courts .
There are also cases where there are different national systems in one country .
The answer is therefore to seek more democracy and reject the extreme right-wing policy , hostilities between people and cynical contempt for others .
It is naive to put hope into a database for the whole of the EU where so many languages are spoken and so many different information systems work when the unsuccessful attempt to create a health database for the UK has led to GBP waste .
In October 2010 , the Commission adopted a communication entitled &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; in order to relaunch the single market .
In the interests of legal certainty and predictability , the EU must now develop an effective , transparent dispute settlement mechanism that is accessible to all investors , including the smallest ( such as small and medium-sized enterprises ) .
This proposal for a European tax is unconstitutional .
We need a plan B , as has already been said correctly , and the rail network is such an alternative .
I would like to express our gratitude to the European Parliament for the additional sum of EUR 3 million , within the framework of the EU budget for 2008 , for the reconstruction of cultural heritage in the wars affected by the western Balkans .
Furthermore , Member States are obliged to ensure that no return operations violating Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights are carried out , which obliges Member States to guarantee that no one returns to his country , if likely , is in danger of being persecuted or serious attack .
It will allow you to do so more effectively than you would have provided that you have exemptions and allow individual funds to function separately .
It is absolutely essential that EU legislation takes into account the particular vulnerability of women and children who are exposed to violence within the home .
I hope that , after 26 elected assemblies have taken their decisions , people will not hold democratic trials in administration by refusing to sign .
The 2010 progress report on Iceland
There are also great differences between Member States in the level of awareness of violence against women .
Membership of Parliament : see Minutes
For me , the key issue is to raise awareness and I think that these reports can contribute to this .
The next item is the vote .
It is important to realise that we are in a period of transition from intergovernmental approach to community access , and I am pleased about that for justice and home affairs .
Let us not forget , however , that the focus must be an effort for the good of the child .
Instead of completely withdrawing micro-entities from the fourth directive , a reduced requirement for financial management should be clearly defined and introduced within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives .

Now Ireland has decided to hold a second referendum .
I welcome the initiative of the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , to ask the European Union for the official recognition of the genocide committed by the Nazi people and their allies in the Second World War , as this marks a step forward in the defence of the most widespread ethnic minorities in Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , this is not the first time that our colleague , Mr Cohn-Bendit , who called the President - Prime Minister - is a dictator in the style of Hugo Chávez , does not respect democracy .
The Tobin tax is one model which has been proposed .
Extreme poverty , discrimination and marginalisation continue to affect large numbers of Roma throughout Europe , so it is high time to improve this situation .
The duty of society is to safeguard this free choice and not to discriminate against activities simply because it does not fit into the normal cases of the formal labour market .
In my 30 years of professional experience in accounting and auditing , I have never seen a surveyed auditor say how to do his job .
It is right that Parliament is paying greater attention to the transposition and application of the legislation we are creating here .
I am thinking of the abolition of taxes on textile products imported from Pakistan , which would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Lombari in the rest of Europe .
Membership of committees : see Minutes
All radical changes in European rural areas pose challenges , be they resettlement , jobs , services or the environment .
It is therefore essential to strengthen and develop specific and coordinated cooperation , while also adapting it to the new challenges in international relations .
I expect balanced commitments from Copenhagen , short-term and medium- and controllable , which will be supplemented by financial penalties in the event of failure to fulfil them .
The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) therefore voted against this proposal and wants the cost of any unnecessary losses to be borne by those responsible .
I will ask these questions because , although I am satisfied with the solidarity measures adopted on 11 February , I have serious doubts as to whether Europeans have the situation under control .
They will tell them that , at one time , Europe was divided long ago , there was a great wall that led its centre , and people in the east were very poor and did not have democracy and lived in a bad system that was called Communism , which killed millions of its own people .
Let me remind you that the Polish Parliament approved the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in April this year , but the ratification documents are yet to be signed by the President .
I agree with her in her in her assessment of the Commission &apos;s proposal , and I would like to say a few words about how important such activities are .
The next item is the joint debate on :
The most important thing is for the negotiations to start , and Parliament is ready to start them .
We believe that the allegations made against them are unfounded , and I can assure you that we will still endeavour to cooperate in all possible ways with the Iranian authorities to resolve these matters satisfactorily - that is , to say , for the people concerned to be released .
The Jobbik Party would like to put an end to the economic monopoly of multinationals and to Europe &apos;s small farmers and family businesses so that , with their help , we can eliminate unemployment within the European Community .
in writing . - I voted in line with the recommendations of the Civil Liberties Package against this proposal for a decision .
The challenges are as follows : firstly , to move towards a common immigration policy ; secondly , to significantly improve the organisation of migration leave ; thirdly , to improve integration procedures ; thirdly , to combat illegal immigration ; fourth , to develop Frontex ; and to improve procedures , conventions and agreements with the countries of origin and transit ; and seven to develop a common asylum policy .
With the Irish &apos; yes &apos; , we know that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force ; we know this because the referendum was the last obstacle .
The greatest emphasis is on employment because , if unemployment is not reduced , the entire economic recovery process will be at risk .
The European Union must serve as a model in terms of improving the rules and in terms of sound efforts .
1 336 redundancies were made in the period from 14 June to 14 October 2010 , and 1 498 were released before and following this reference period .
The objective of this process is to complete and report on the outcome of the negotiations at the June Council .
in writing . - The 2008 financial crisis has made it clear that the European supervisory authorities need to coordinate the regulation and supervision of the financial sector in the European Union .
We mention , for example , research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme , in particular , those involved by the Israeli cosmic industry , which produced a no-fly aircraft used in the attacks on the Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009 , with dozens of people killed .
( LT ) Thank you , Minister , for the efforts you have made as the country holding the Presidency to combat poverty .
I am one of those who believe that without a global agreement , all our efforts are on the table .
I would like to highlight one point in the Commission &apos;s draft statement , which is directed at the proposal .
All three reports maintain the approach and perspectives outlined in the new Single Market Strategy drawn up by Professor Mario Monti , showing them that 50 measures to relaunch the European Single Market , which Parliament is further taking and combining in 14 priorities or in this form , are pursuing a single objective .
Governments in the Gulf of Gulf respond differently : generous financial packages to ease the most urgent and social needs , statements on political reforms , the transfer of certain legislative powers to elected bodies or open up to comprehensive national dialogue , promoting inclusion .
As far as Mr Ziobro &apos;s argument is concerned , the interfering of the Strasbourg Court in the powers of the Union is not in danger .
I would go back to the table during the negotiations on the reform of POSEI .
in writing . - I would like to reiterate the admiration expressed during this debate for the courage of both the people of Tunisia and Egypt to express their dissatisfaction and disappointment with their regimes .
So I simply do not understand why we cannot accept the same programme for this reason .
The European Union has established legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support for workers affected by the consequences of far-reaching changes in world trade patterns and to assist them reintegrate them into the labour market .
The different nature of the final text and the guarantees it lays down for users &apos; rights are the responsibility of its negotiating skills .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to introduce a requirement for EU Member States to report annually on the activities of their export credit agencies in terms of risk calculations and to establish information on underlying transactions and to have an obligation to inform them about the calculations about social and environmental risks .
Mrs Ronzulli , listen and please remain silent .
This is an important fact , demonstrating Parliament &apos;s willingness and ability to offer itself as a candidate for the CFSP / CSDP based on what I would call the dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I broadly support this report because Member States have a major role to play in managing , labelling and protecting wilderness areas .
First of all , after the completion of the many months &apos; process , I am relieving of the wishes of this House to see the service come into being to reflect the needs of the electorate that you represent and to be a service that will serve them well .
That concludes this item .
These and other issues could be discussed at the summit .
Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity must not be called into question .
So you can see that this is almost the same level .
This is why it is important to remind you that , this year , in 2009 , the Commission undertook to present to this Parliament a communication assessing possible pan-European threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information and pointing out the importance of preparing a directive which will guarantee pluralism of information in terms of new technologies , and especially television .
The effective application of the proposed directive and the substitute of the shortcomings identified during the transposition and application of previous directives will increase the possibility of protecting EU citizens against discrimination .
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report , which stresses the importance of European political parties as essential actors in political life in the European Union and makes concrete proposals for creating a safe and transparent regulatory environment for their functioning and funding .
We therefore need an ambitious budget if we want to achieve the objectives that are set here every week , and that means not less money , but more money in the future .
Yanukovych won the presidential elections democratically , albeit with little difference .
At a time when we are strongly feeling the effects of the recession and the public debt crisis , we need strong economic governance at EU level .
The joint debate is closed .
The rapporteur considers all the conditions for abolishing border controls with Bulgaria and Romania to be fulfilled , but asks for the European Parliament to be informed of further measures to be taken at the border of Bulgaria , Greece and Turkey , which is one of the most sensitive areas in terms of illegal immigration .
I am pleased to say that the Air passengers &apos; rights regulation has proven its fundamental importance as a trademark network which ensures that passengers are not swamped by the financial consequences of interruptions to air traffic and are not even party-free .
As in 2004 , the Council Presidency will be called on to select this important candidate from the largest group of the European Parliament , and then our Parliament will be given its opinion on this choice , which is one of the first major political actions in the new parliamentary term .
We must ask all political forces to put an end to this crisis , because the only option is to isolate Albania and to threaten its European perspective .
I agreed with this resolution on the effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
I also maintain that we must demand the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba and the rest of the world , but I recommend that we not adopt measures that have already proven to be a failure in terms of progress towards democracy and liberalisation , such as embargo and blockade .
In the interests of the citizens of Sri Lanka , I want the expression I have heard time and again - &apos; war is an institution &apos; - to finally become a past .
Public opinion is very sensitive and condemns pointless and painful practices .
Secondly , if we are serious that we want to achieve the target of a 95 % reduction in emissions by 2050 , then the plan of our procedure obliges us to withdraw them by at least 30 % by 2020 .
Although it was agreed between the entire sector and the investor groups , three years after the introduction of the MiFID between market participants , there was no agreement on the form of this consolidated system .
We also need to give the regulators greater powers to ensure that these demands are properly met .
Like Mr Tajani , I would like to extend warm and grateful to Commissioner Barrot &apos;s work , which was very important , as well as the goodwill shown by the French Presidency .
It is missing from our House , but the Swedish Presidency has certainly obtained it .
Europe must ensure that we increase our energy consumption much more .
Their purpose is to buy goods and services at the best price .
However , we Swedish Social Democrats are equally pleased that you have , in the end , partly heard Parliament &apos;s demands and demands that women &apos;s and children &apos;s rights be included in this programme to a greater extent .
It is clear that a variety of changes are now being made in the Member States .
The opposite of what the aforementioned organisations planned .
( FR ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s resolution shows that in this area , like many others , our institution has absolutely no opportunity to assess the dogma that is attacking us .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Van Rompuy , ladies and gentlemen , I see two important issues relating to the proposed changes to Article 136 , one institutional , another political one .
It is therefore a step in the right direction .
However , I do not agree that the fight against HIV should be associated with such a sensitive issue as abortion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as regards the annual report ( 2007 ) on the main aspects and basic choices of the Common European Foreign and Security Policy , I would like to highlight some important questions from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets .
Finally , the lack of any reference to undemocratic decisions and persecution of citizens , such as the ban on Communist parties and other organisations and the imprisonment of Communists and other activists in Central and Baltic Member States , reveals the true nature of the report .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon .
We must put a stop to free market policies , we must stop the free movement of capital , we must promote food sovereignty , we must state water and energy for global public property and we must combat social economic imbalances .
Firstly , that the future of agricultural production in the Community must also be ensured after 2013 ,
This raises the question of whether this means the existing projects , which are already funded from the Cohesion Fund or new projects .
That is why we have to say that we have to stand by these people , following President Mubarak &apos;s speech today , after the regime broke out its dogs and after the violent journey .
Today , I would like to thank the Chairs of the Borrella and Pöttering , as well as the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament , for supporting Michael &apos;s fight for freedom .
I therefore voted against the report :
I see Portugal as more benefits than losing for this binding target .
In order for women to earn as much as a man who is against a calendar year as that , on average , they would have to work until the end of February in total of 418 days .
For decades , they have been systematically discriminated against and intimidated by assimilation and death , and their identity is under threat .
This report concerns the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I , too , would like to thank the Commissioner for coming here tonight to explain in more detail what competences she wants .
It ignored the main issues of reorganisation of the international monetary system .
Human rights must be at the heart of her attention .
Consequently , these companies would no longer be tempted to become involved in illegal activities .
( CS ) Mr President , High Representative , ladies and gentlemen , the EU &apos;s common visa policy is now facing a major challenge , in the form of the 10 months of permanent visa requirements for citizens of the Czech Republic on Canada .
EMA plays a key role as a preferred source of information .
I have received a proposal to change today &apos;s vote : after yesterday &apos;s meeting of President Buzek and Prime Minister Zapatero , it was agreed that dialogue on certain procedural aspects relating to Council discharge would be initiated immediately at the highest institutional level .

If we were to go to the old Rome Senate , one senator would certainly stand up in his tone , and Mr Trichet would say : &apos; Quousque tandem abutere , Trichpatientia , patientia and night ? &apos; - how long , Trichet , how long would you like to examine our patience ?
Finally , Mr President , if you will allow any possible suspicion to be dispelled , I would like to suggest that the European Parliament &apos;s investigation committee be set up on this matter .
In order to achieve greater flexibility and to take account of cultural differences , concessions on services were consciously excluded from the public procurement directives .
I can agree with some of the other ideas that have been expressed , but I think we need to ensure that Article 4 is brief and understandable .
I believe that this network could be very useful , but at the moment , it is not working effectively and its potential is not fully utilised .
It is , of course , true that the Economic Partnership Agreements differ from the Lomé Convention and the Cotonou Agreement , which governed the Union &apos;s relations with ACP countries for 30 years , but unilateral preferences characterising these conventions could openly call into question other developing countries within the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
However , while we fully support the integration of the Roma in the European Union , we do indeed have serious doubts about the involvement of the European Union in matters which , in our opinion , should have provided individual Member States , such as access to healthcare , education , employment and housing .
At the same time , priority must be given to food security , agriculture , infrastructure , capacity building and , above all , economic growth and access to technology , as well as to the human and social development of the LDCs .
We cannot continue like this .
The ultimate objective is better enforcement of EU legislation , and therefore improved animal health and welfare .
What measures will you take to help rich countries contribute to the cost of this crisis ?
We also need to have best practice , as Slovenia , for example , monitors vehicles throughout the country .
It is also important that these measures do not only serve our citizens today and tomorrow , but also ensure the future of our children .
If we want to prevent the catch from being stopped , we need to keep it to 30 % .
In this regard , we have urgent priorities to address .
Cohesion policy must not only contribute to levelling out productivity gaps caused by the crisis , but also to reverting the growth in productivity to the right track .
This is a very important question for all EU citizens and a lot about how the Commission and Parliament deal with it will be about accountability and transparency .
In summary , let me stress that all the non-standard measures that we have taken during a period of sudden financial stringency are of temporary nature and have been proposed with a view to putting an end to them .
This report is appalling with what it proposes when it comes to the behaviour of this Parliament .
a strict organisation of projects , the efficient use of resources and clear conditions with regard to their duration ;
This is not possible at present , and as you say , patients are in danger .
I would also like to say in advance that I support all Turkey &apos;s efforts and aspirations towards democratisation .
In this proposal , the Commission is expanded by the definition of micro-entities to include a business that does not even exceed one of the two criteria : a total margin of EUR 500 000 , a net turnover of EUR 1 000 and / or an average number of workers during the financial year 10 .
However , we must fulfil our commitment to climate change : everyone will recognise that we are world leaders on this matter .
rapporteur . - Madam President , you have given me a little surprise , because I have not seen the complete change in the timetable today , but I am very grateful to the House for being able to address the very important issue of the financial services sector , that is to say the insurance and hedge activities sector that we have done within the framework of the Solvency II report and how we have now put it forward to Parliament so that they can , in my opinion , establish a very concrete basis for regulation throughout the European Union .
It is therefore absolutely essential to raise our target to 30 % , and I will conclude by mentioning the words of Barack Obama , who said that we can leave our future jobs to our competitors or use this opportunity for the century , just as they have already started .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to make four points .
For this reason , together with several other Members , I have invited the expert to investigate organ trafficking and the deliberate killing of people by means of organs for transplantation in China and which they will speak here .
President-in-Office of the Council , we would like to thank you for your very constructive , wide-ranging report and wish you all the best when performing the presidency !
These initiatives assisting EC funds combine us to work on specific projects and programmes and to exploit the potential of each institution .
- ( SK ) In the area of respect for the rights of national minorities in Slovakia , there is not something right again , due to the Minister of School , the leader of an extremely nationalistic party .
In view of the necessary guarantees , such as the possibility for European citizens to be able to make administrative appeals and be treated as well as by US citizens , and the tough action against the time during which information is retained is the cooperation between Europe and the United States in this case due to the negative effects of globalisation .
The EIB can , and must , play an important role in managing the events that have taken place recently in the Mediterranean region .
I therefore support the request to examine the share of the margin in the production and distribution chain .
But , if you always put the polluter pays principle at the forefront of the principle - I am ready to discuss with you - then it is the Member States that cause congestion by not building enough infrastructure .
The first is student mobility credits .
However , it is important for us to be aware that , although there is a severe crisis on Europe &apos;s very fringes , here we have an opportunity to deepen its affection and the bite that citizens feel for what Europe represents : added value in terms of response .
Today , Europe is losing even though it has a greater percentage of educated population than China or India .
That is why we need more and better Europe : a more united and ambitious Europe .
I am sure this is a step in the right direction .
The Greek Communist Party is against and voted against the amendments intended to adapt the European Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to make the following observation : it is most surprising that , while Albania &apos;s growth indicators are constantly increasing and in 2010 , in the midst of global economic instability , they have exceeded 2 % growth and , as expected , they should reach 3 % , yet social tension is getting worse .
Human trafficking is still a very serious problem in the European Union .
Furthermore , I would like to follow on from Mr Papario and to highlight other issues .
In Southern Sudan , the EU must make an important contribution to the stabilisation , development and building of institutional capacities .
As you said , the 13th amendment in Sri Lanka needs to be applied , which provides valuable assistance here .
Let me reiterate that there may be different opinions on the regulation of water transport and there are indeed different views between the Commission , the Council and also some Members of this House ; some would have preferred separate legislation for river and maritime transport .
I support the principle of this proposal , particularly the need to define a consistent and comprehensive framework for developing investments in the Union &apos;s energy infrastructure , which will allow the Commission to monitor the state of development of planned investment projects in the energy sector .
The early in 1995 was hopeless , a global consensus was reached that makes women and men equal in all respects , including political , economic , legal and social .
The Serbian authorities must take every step to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are correctly applied in the country , and must also ensure that severe penalties are constantly decreased in Serbia and that those who abuse power are imposed on their offices .
The directive for which the Commission intends to adhere to its proposals therefore give the Europe for which we are fighting - Europe of justice and social progress , economic and social cohesion , cooperation between sovereign and equal states and Europe , which promotes peace - a total of weak prospects for implementation .
From the point of view of democracy and legitimacy , it is important that we inform our citizens about what the EU is doing .
We Germans would not be able to promote our national unity fairly if we did not see this as a contribution to Europe &apos;s unity in the light of the past historic events I have indicated here .
In plain language , Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner will carry out a single person .
As I said before in this House on previous occasions , I come before you as a person enthusiastic about the Europe of cooperating nations .
- Report : Elles
In the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats abstained .
Moreover , the compulsory nature of the register for lobbyists who want regular access to Parliament and the Commission is an important step in increasing the transparency of relations between these organisations and the European institutions .
However , if we approve everything at first reading , Parliament will itself be preparing for its rights .
This is a very important step which will allow the citizens of the European Union to exercise their fundamental rights more effectively .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the vote on the Kirilov report will take place in a few weeks &apos; time , and this is a fact that I welcome , because we really urgently need it .
Personally , I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation , as most of the vans are buying large entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurs , who are already well aware of the need to save and make economical use of fuel .
I propose carrying out a study into consolidated accounts .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to comment on the situation in general and then ask about two or three things depending on how much time you leave me .
We must also not forget that , when Turkey is in the European Union , we will have states like Iraq , Iraq and Syria on our borders .
I think we must finally understand that we cannot talk about economic policy without constantly thinking about employment .
What would we expect from the EU ?
We must not forget that we are responsible for all our negotiations for the voters who are currently going through a difficult period .
For the same reason , however , these agencies can represent significant distortions in trade if their financial operations are not subject to common rules .
I believe that the governance of the Single Market can only be proper if good and up-to-date information on its operation is available .
in writing . - ( ET ) During the current period of global economic crisis ( i.e. the economic recession and rising unemployment ) , the reality in the EU labour market is that more and more redundancies will be made due to the growing number of people experiencing poverty and estrangement in Europe .
They have , of course , already had a flag , they have already had the anthem , but they were going to create a new state .
These matters include to some extent the notion of corporate social responsibility , but cannot be carried out without a national framework .
This is a real compromise .
In addition , proper operational assistance must be provided in case of accidents where passengers are offered services and things they will need most .
The Council is adopting this joint text and the President of the European Parliament can therefore finally declare the budget approved .
We must support the creation of a private financing mechanism and more frequent acceptance of public and legal initiatives to strengthen the European resettlement programme .
However , we also have the ambition to put an end to misleading Internet advertising , which not only affects patients but can do harm to them .
Mr President , I would like to make an oral amendment to this amendment ; I would delete two parts of the amendment , namely the words &apos; Colombia Army &apos; and &apos; Colombia &apos; .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete steps and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination of the Roma in Europe .
Madam President , once again , I think this is one of those reports that people can accept with gratitude .
However , once again , we need to draw attention to the excessive delays between the date of disaster , the decision to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund and the actual delivery of EU aid to the Member States and affected areas .
We need legal evidence and we have therefore asked the French Government for the components of these people .
Europe must not be just the sum of 27 national interests .
Mr Reinfeldt will report on the work of the European Council over the last six months .
The disadvantages of austerity measures which will deprive workers of jobs in the public sector need to be turned into benefits for start-up companies , utilise the spirit of entrepreneurship and reduce initial costs for companies to help create the profitable private sector that we need if our countries are to get out of the problems we are currently experiencing .
Both communities are unable to formulate a common vision and , as a result , progress has stopped .
In fact , this free trade agreement only corresponds to the division of economic power between Europe and India as we now know , or will this agreement still be fitting for 10 or 15 years ?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access throughout the EU to 2013 and rapid Internet connections by 2020 .
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the global crisis , it is due , first and foremost , to the lack of immediate responses needed when this crisis broke out in the Republic of Moldova .
European workers and poor people across Europe must mobilise their forces against these catastrophic policies and join in the fight for a truly democratic and socialist Europe , which means standing up against the policies of this new EU Commission .
The European Parliament defends its powers as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
The welfare requirements are now officially included in the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when policy making in the internal market , for example .
It is expressed , in particular , at the level of the regions and their cultural heritage , and it is a visa which will be taken into account and emphasised in the context of regional development policy .
I think that is where we should now focus our efforts .
You will need all your persuasive skills in order to introduce a new impetus in international trade policy in the EU .
This reserve is indeed the &apos; accounting &apos; method that should be used in any event of unforeseeable emergencies that could take place during the current financial year .
Let us stand now for a minute &apos;s silence for our Tunisian friends .
Many errors and one accused : the euro .
With regard to the initiatives I have just described , I believe that there is now a sound basis on which we can base the improvement of the fisheries and aquaculture sector through innovative research which will be part of the framework programme .
We have this debate too technocratic .
I therefore congratulate Mr Millán Mon for his excellent report , which comes at the best time to strengthen relations between the two continents .
We therefore need to propose a significant simplification of EU legislation .
Unfortunately , important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have been rejected and , as a result , the initiatives cannot sign EU residents who are not citizens , which hinder equal involvement of residents , regardless of nationality , nor the guarantee that signatures will be compatible with the identification numbers of signatories .
I call for the creation of an independent commission composed of local and international legal professionals to investigate and prosecute the violent events following the elections in December 2007 .
NATO &apos;s credibility and the so-called West also largely depend on results in Afghanistan .
This is already going too far and needs to be stopped .
The creation of a manual for public and private actors and the establishment of a system of education and mobility relating to the application of multi-level governance could constitute effective measures for improving regional policy .
I hope our Spanish and Italian colleagues will join us , but we cannot afford to wait any further because the whole world is trying to keep to the innovation market .
Furthermore , I believe that we need to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and ensure that future strategies , starting with the next reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , are adequately adapted to these requirements .
Mr President , the ongoing negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Vietnam must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties .
Without reservations about the adoption of some important measures proposed in this report , I would now like to draw attention to one essential element of this problem .
However , this method will not create the economy and the jobs of bureaucracy , unfair competition or unforeseen price volatility .
This will not have a negative effect on the cod population , as there is currently a very small amount of undesirable by-catch catches .
The proposed sanctions are proportionate and necessary , and we hope they will prevent the inappropriate business practices that traders have occupied .
In my opinion , this criterion is unreasonable and discriminatory , as in Portugal , the majority of these families live in chatrists in rural areas .
This is about assessing poverty , which is based on absolute and purely financial factors and does not take into account the difference between the 27 Member States ; its argument line can be summarised as a mere solvency issue .
Therefore , both official development aid and new funds will need to be provided .
The efficient audit of the work of this project has produced a positive result and the project has been confirmed .
In my opinion , the proposed cofinancing rate of 75 % is too high .
I would like to clarify two things , ladies and gentlemen .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the Commissioner for paying attention to the problem of Tunisia .
Above all , the rapporteur regrets the fact that citizens do not realise what rights they would enjoy .
Although the creation of an area of security , freedom and justice in the European Union is of paramount importance to all of us , and is certainly an example of the European democratic model that we are building , and , while many of us consider Europol to be an instrument that can be adapted , we all attach great weight to pooling resources - especially human resources , but also technical means of combating crime and all kinds of trafficking - thus far as we have as much as possible legal certainty for European citizens &apos; rights and as possible .
It is therefore essential to take measures which could strengthen the guarantee that impact assessments will be transparent and independent , as this will help maximise the role of this instrument as a assistant to the decision-making process and as a guarantee of the quality and suitability of the EU institutions .
My second point is that the strategy should strengthen the European Union &apos;s internal cohesion , in other words its convergence .
Perhaps I might add that this is not the direction taken by the Commission , as its proposal focused on the regulation adopted by this House on the reform of the existing agencies system that are private and on the very strict consolidation of transparency requirements in order not to conflict with interest and on the integrity of their ratings activities .
It also calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits arising from the creation of a completely independent European credit rating agency .
Even before the crisis we are facing today , the Member States of the European Union have been confronted with social problems resulting from weak economic growth , complex demographic situations and life-threatening global economies .
There are , however , reasons which give rise to some fears and which may cause the enthusiasm of Moldova to come to an end .
We here in Parliament have always been consistent in defending the autonomous rights of the Tibetan people , which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence .
Although the directive will soon see the light of the world , I voted , together with other Members , in favour of the resolution outlining the objective that Parliament is to pursue in this matter .
In this context , it is indeed important to establish a system for monitoring and controlling medicines which will provide patients with reliable information .
It is worth fighting for this , and that is what I intend to do .
However , some exceptions will be admitted to these costs , provided that the Member State that asks for them has good reason to do so .
in writing . - ( LT ) This framework decision should not lead to disproportionate bureaucracy in cases where problems are easily accessible in the most appropriate way .
The Bank has not recognised that it is a great crisis and has not been too early even in dealing with it , which is far from perfect .
However , the European Union , as a serious organisation , should be better prepared for such a situation and , in particular , should be prepared to respond effectively in urgent cases .
- Report : Kaczmarek
We should therefore only support its inclusion if these measures are not effective .
I promised to realise this civil protest by the European institutions .
The European Union and industrialised countries should adopt the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 % by 2020 , and the long-term objective of reducing emissions by at least 80 % by 2050 , compared with 1990 .
- Report : Maria do Céu Patrão Neves
I would like to comment more closely on two unresolved issues which were raised several times during the debate .
On behalf of the Council , I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for this cooperation and for the compromise atmosphere , which has enabled us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of bus and coach passengers , particularly with regard to people with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility .
One of the reasons for this is our fragmented defence equipment market .
At the beginning of this period , the issue of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy sources was an important point .
The creation of the EEAS will not be without a series of decisions , probably not without amendments to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations of Officials , which require both Commission proposals and the adoption of the codecision procedure .
We fully support the development of civilian capabilities for the proper balance of resources .
in writing . - The situation in North Africa is really serious but also hopeful .
Coordination requires constant improvements , and certainly the responsibility of the Member States in this area should be increased .
With its strong election , the Irish people are giving us the strength to continue with success and to build a strong and , above all , federal Europe .
Although environmental protection and the security of public health go hand in hand , I believe that we need to find a balance between the needs of consumers and producers .
It is a hunger call that we have to tackle together .
We need to work with the main consumer countries , such as the US , China , Russia and Japan , to address this problem and to establish a global warning and registration system for illegally harvested timber and relevant countries for using the Internet , the competent UN body using the latest satellite technology systems .
Of course , we cannot allow short-term support for the car industry so as not to jeopardise its long-term competitiveness .
I think it is a report based on the principle of subsidiarity .
Given the consequences of the current economic and social crisis , the fight against unemployment and social exclusion has brought serious attention to the European public and the European institutions .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to say that , in my opinion , this issue is too important to continue living in the lies we live in Europe .
We did not know , as has already been mentioned , the names of the candidates and we did not have a candidate - although , to be fair to Commissioner Barnier , the Commissioner has explained this sufficiently .
We are passing over the low turnout in the European elections and the negative results of referendums .
We need to find out what has happened and we will tell you , Mr Coelho .
( PL ) Mr President , horizontal cooperation agreements apply to a very wide range of regulations and omissions in these legal provisions , whether deliberate or intrusive , can lead to the elimination of competition .
We also need a more effective common European asylum system which will ensure a greater degree of protection .
That concludes Question Time .
At the same time , I am aware that we are all happy to engage in police cooperation that respects human rights and respects the values of the European Union .
The same horror inherited Picas on his turn from Guernica illustrating our Guernicu , compared to the Le Condor seven decades ago by countries .
In this sense , speculators can also attempt to cultivate themselves in a bad economic situation , and can sometimes get worse .
Mr Bové is certainly right , and my colleague , Favel , is deeply ...
We need to promote not only competitiveness , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farmers , organic farms and local distribution , thereby ensuring that agriculture is maintained throughout Europe .
Mr Rapkay &apos;s report on the amendments to the Staff Regulations in connection with the establishment of the European External Action Service , the EEAS , is a very important document on the path towards creating a Union foreign policy .
We therefore believe , and we will discuss this again at first reading , that initial spending reflects this priority , and we agree with the rapporteur &apos;s emphasis on the issue of multilingualism and the issue of buildings , which are issues that we have always prioritised , but in legislative terms .
A few weeks ago , I had the honour of conducting a delegation from the Committee on International Trade of this Parliament attending the Seventh World Trade Ministerial Conference in Geneva .
If this Europe is in mind , it will be able to move forward with a pride of contempt .
I have urged the Member States to indicate candidates , including women .
Above all , it is essential to maintain geographical distribution in the context of financial assistance from the EU budget for Mediterranean states and Eastern European states , in accordance with the provisions of the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 - as well as to continue providing support to these countries by lending by the European Investment Bank .
We believe that Kosovo is an exceptional case and we want to stress that Spain and four other Member States have not been recognised .
This is sufficient reason not to invite Alexander Lukashenko at the EU summit in light of the appeal from the Belarusian opposition .
A very important approach is to draw attention to the true human dimension and element of the complexity of our policy , even if it is an internal market .
Mr President , I would like to join in supporting what has been said by previous speakers about the rights of disabled passengers , as Mrs Kadenbach said about children being taken care of fire and , above all , security provided by fire springs in all hotels in the EU , and the need for a new proposal to be made for the future .
I also wanted to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment .
It is clear from the report that only the Member States have the power to decide on defence and national security , which we consider to be important to emphasise .
Similarly , it is the case for those Member States that are most worried about the asset stripping of companies and the hidden takeovers , as they do not have the underlying limits for publishing shareholders in society or the different contract .
I would also like to thank my colleague , Mr Lehne , for his approach .
In other words , the Copenhagen Accord contains references to the level of ambition required to tackle climate change in the post-2012 climate agreement , laying down the foundations for the financial package and encourages serious commitments to reduce emissions .
AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis will require around four million lives every year .
Rather than just in commercial terms , I would like to ask the Commissioner for his assurance that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) cannot be used to prevent the sale of medicines at more competitive prices ; safe , generic medicines that do not infringe copyright and whose only crime is that they are manufactured by developing countries , such as Brazil or the West .
Yet Members have the right to make a contribution .
This is unacceptable .
We want to engage in solving them .
We therefore need to find the right level of financial and technological refunds .
This is also an area where we can take more decisive action as part of competition and consumer protection policy .
It is also clear that these politicians require us to accept the result of the second referendum when they did not accept the result of this first referendum .
As co-author of the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on Kyrgyzstan , I wish to express my thanks to my fellow Members of Parliament who have today voted in favour of this document .
Finally , Mr President , Minister , I will make recommendations for future generations .
It is absolutely crucial that clear rules and objectives be laid down for waste electrical and electronic equipment management in order to consolidate the internal market in a sustainable way and improve environmental quality in the European Union , as well as reuse strategic raw materials .
The Heads of State or Government have also stressed that nuclear safety must not be limited within the territory of the European Union and that we will also ask our neighbours to carry out these stress tests .
A very precise distinction needs to be maintained between the remit of military and humanitarian forces , with a dialogue between those troops that would strengthen mutual understanding .
The Commission continues to work on a more systematic assessment of the quality of public finances , including the drafting of the budget on the basis of performance .
I consider this a priority as Commissioner for Trade .
Therefore , depending on the situation , the Commission will table an amended or new proposal .
However , the United States must introduce clear , transparent criteria for denying visas in certain Member States .
What remains open is the issue of funding .
I want to say to other colleagues that constructive criticism of Turkey is necessary ; we ourselves are critical of it .
Studies show that human trafficking earnings exceed profits from drug smuggling and distribution .
Farmers in my part of the world feel completely mature and , frankly , degrading the fact that there are certain premises here that they do not know what they are doing and that they have to be told .
No .
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution ; given the negative impact of liberalising markets on the local economy , it stresses the strategic importance of adequate customs protection .
In general , I am voting in favour of the proposals put forward in this report aimed at reviving the European economy through greater financial assistance for energy projects .
Therefore , the report on the European Refugee Fund , which calls for the resettlement of refugees in the EU - as this report does - is all the more incomprehensible .
This is the estimated value that can be increased .
Economic experts , using mathematical models , highlight the value of domestic work .
Only once we are fully informed about such cases can we talk about the consistent monitoring of the application of EU law .
I repeat : resolutely not .
There is also an urgent need , particularly on the eve of the Copenhagen conference , for the EU and other international players to formulate their policies on international trade , climate change , humanitarian aid and development .
I would like to refer to Commissioner Rehn &apos;s statement , which I personally respect , and which has said that Nigeria is a very poor country : it is not true , Nigeria is a very rich country , but it is plagued by a corrupt and incompetent class , which has plunged the country &apos;s resources and left millions of citizens impoverished .
Finally , Mr Mölzer , I want to tell you not to be so pessimistic .
I therefore call on the Council to immediately announce its opinion on Parliament &apos;s new proposal so that ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010 , and I ask the Commission to ensure that producers and exporters from ACP countries , in turn , comply adequately with social and environmental requirements .
This imposes on the Commission - as the coordinator of the Energy Community - to bring Ukraine together and to remind it of its commitments in terms of security of supply in Europe .
in writing . - Of course , we regret the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes , regardless of whether the atrocities concerned have been committed in Europe or , for example , in former European colonies .
The main objective of this adjustment must be , instead of imposing a bureaucratic and costly procedure for controlling all products , to implement a new common culture of control and responsibility .
Member of the Commission . - The current EU competition policy and vertical agreements are very much in favour of online sales , which you are certainly well aware , Mr President .
On the other hand , the report contains clear recommendations with regard to the second and third errors and all these recommendations go in the right direction .
As far as transport is concerned , it is necessary to do much more by imposing restrictions on vehicle manufacturers to come up with greater fuel efficiency .
The financial situation in some euro area countries , which are being discussed today , clearly demonstrates the risks from the arrangements of the Stability and Growth Pact .
I therefore think it is good to consider pragmatically how we can best use the funds saved to extend the European Energy Programme &apos;s scope for recovery to include a new one , and it would appear that even the necessary , single financial instrument to promote energy efficiency and renewable initiatives .
We in Parliament have deliberately chosen to leave the issue of the processing of the funds completely out of the question , because when we work , we are based on the assumption that the sector will live up to its promise and deal with this matter itself , without any legislative pressure .
This brings me to two questions relating to the Europe 2020 strategy .
( EL ) Madam President , with regard to the processing industry , I should like to remind the House that Pakistan is the world &apos;s fourth largest cotton producer , which represents 9 % of world production , the European Union is following with less than 5.5 % .
In this case , the Council and , above all , this Parliament , are also involved in deciding on the composition of the College and on the portfolios that you have created and the programme for the next five years you are presenting .
We have to understand that things are done in just a year and that we should move forward in 2009 .
Of course , this is reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people , as countries are already in recession and living conditions are getting worse , inequality is getting worse and poverty is on the increase .
These objectives , President of the Commission and President of the Council , are already in the 2020 strategy .
We have already discussed with many Arab countries the initiatives to obtain gas via Turkey , hopefully with the Nabucco pipeline .
That is why taking steps to eradicate this disease completely is the objective of a health policy that the Member States &apos; governments can best contribute to by being sufficiently flexible about this measure .
This is my last contribution in this House , so I would like to thank you , all my colleagues and employees , for your cooperation .
I am aware of the fact that there are currently significant differences between the electoral rules in the individual Member States .
Many obsolete doctors are clearly starting to prescribe anti-dementia medicines too late not to exceed their budgets , which is counterproductive .
Paradoxically , this instrument could be misused in practice and not only by extremists , but also by very strong and powerful interest groups , and I say this because we think that the 1 000 declaration of support is not high compared to the Union &apos;s demographic potential .
The 2010 budget lays the foundations for this systemic approach .
According to the UN task force , the victims of trafficking in women with diverse social proportions , from the richest to the poorest , from very educated to completely uneducated , from young to elderly women .
President-in-Office of the Council . - This is indeed a very important question .
We need more and better economic governance in Europe when it comes to national measures to support this idea , including a financial transaction tax , which I urge the Commission to take a close look at , including in the European context .
I think that it is very important to have mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States , because we are not only talking about healthcare , but also about follow-up care , but only for a while we have a while to get the details right .
Firstly , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports , which raise important issues concerning the contribution of the EU &apos;s trade policy to achieving some basic public policy objectives : respect for human rights , economic prosperity and social justice , sustainable growth and respect for the environment and , in particular , the climate system .
Consumers will have a number of corrective means at their disposal if they purchase a product which does not comply with the treaty and will have the right to seek redress if the remedy is not provided .
Mr President , the reason for this urgent debate is the brutal murder of 57 people accompanied by a policy on the road to their registration as a electoral candidate for the post of provincial guard .
This new intelligent and symmetric system will lead to stricter supervision , a more thorough assessment by the Commission , the European Parliament , the Council and the European Central Bank , and a proposal for further reforms and corrective plans .
The Syrian people deserve the long-awaited political reforms , particularly those relating to freedom of expression , assembly , participation in politics and governance .
Many of them were UK citizens and were trafficked on their territory , not from external resources , if I may say so .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the third quarter of 2009 , the European Union returned to growth , which could lead us to the forecast that the worst is over .
In this context , Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reforms aimed at increasing the effectiveness of public administration , accelerated implementation of pension and health reforms , improving the functioning of the labour market and efficiency of the wage negotiations system , improving the functioning of the market in products and the business environment , and maintaining the stability of the banking and financial sectors .
We believe that when concluding agreements between sovereign states , it is still necessary to refer to the following terms : respect for the sovereignty of the state and its citizens , common interests , reciprocity and cooperation , taking into account each country &apos;s specific characteristics ; evaluation of the benefits of each country in economic , social and cultural terms .
I think that the transition to a sustainable , ecological economy will continue without unnecessary legislative measures .
As if everyone had forgotten the contribution of the US and , of course , NATO to peace in Europe .
I think we should see this as a good opportunity to deal with what Europe urgently needs : economic growth , jobs , the dynamic sector of small businesses , more innovation , more effective procurement - these are the things that our citizens will judge .
It is not our job to predict possible developments in these countries .
The second initiative concerns concessions .
Madam President , during the European elections in 2004 , Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in workplaces , so we met many indignant voters before restaurants and hospitals .
In fact , at a time of failed action by individual states to increase the EU budget , the lack of confidence in the joint project and the strengthening of action at supranational level .
I know that we have something to say , so let us make a point and talk .
This report contains guidelines on how to analyse air agreements in terms of content and procedures adopted .
The language law in question creates an imbalance .
When the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force on 1 December , perhaps the British domestic debate will remain behind the doors of this House .
That is the difference between the real situation and the European Parliament &apos;s fantasy .
Furthermore , we support the request to involve national parliaments in accordance with their budgetary and control rights in order to increase transparency , commitment and accountability in relation to any decision taken , including those taken at European level .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , there were five questions about economic governance and two questions about the Europe 2020 strategy .
That is why I think we should actively involve the national authorities , the European Commission and also Members of this Parliament in promoting SOLVIT .
This system , which is based on real policies and guidelines , and is being taken care , Mr Michel , on protagonists and liberal talk , has caused the current situation : the promotion of an agro-industrial model , along with the protection of the interests of the major agro-industrial industry , and the resulting qualitative degradation of the world &apos;s agricultural industry , the years of disproportionate investment in the agricultural economy , and 70 % of the world &apos;s fauna industry , which provides .
Economically , the amount of funds paid to producers is lower than their production costs , and the CAP must allow this problem to be resolved .
And again , I urge the Commission , in its communication with the government , to insist consistently on this promise until it becomes part of the Congolese rule of law .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I fully understand the considerable interest in the steps taken both inside and outside the Union to address the problems faced by some Member States in relation to their public finances .
We sympathise with the will of the peoples who want a better life , taking part in power and a better tomorrow .
You also have the support of the Irish Members in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something we should , and indeed we must , monitor to make the world a more free , fairer and friendly place in the future .

The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the review of the rules on horizontal competition cooperation - B7-0565 / 2010 ) .
That is what you have fought for together , be it orange or pray .
I believe that this procedure , as well as strengthening food security for the EU &apos;s public , will bring greater clarity for the Member States and third countries that export meat products to the EU .
In view of this , it seems foolish to seek agreement with the Mercosur group , particularly when the Swedish Institute on Food and Technology stated that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef may be 35th higher than the Irish beef carbon footprint .
The following text is as follows , as is Article 1 of the original regulation amending this regulation : &apos; The same reference rate will be used in the annual review of the amount of prices to be applied in Articles 4a , 4b and 6b and 3 ( 1 ) , where these prices are labelled in different currencies other than the euro &apos; .
Today , the Irish Government has requested solidarity in Europe and has rightly achieved it .
One only has to look at Ireland , a country which has been particularly hard hit by the crisis : its membership of monetary union has protected it from ever greater dimensions of crisis .
It fears the German property entitlements , and on the basis of what I heard about the German politicians , I think his fear is completely justified .
an increase in support from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund , as well as greater financial support for technical activities relating to the preparation and implementation of projects ;
If we do not do something that makes countries realise that they will be affected by dire consequences if they pursue economically nervous policies , then we will not get nowhere .
Strengthening and promoting further action on climate change is very important .
( Applause from the left )
As always with such complex issues , I have received enormous cooperation from my shadow team , which forms the Bernate Vergnaud , Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle .
In Russia , freedom of the press and media are indeed a major problem .
Similarly , Member States have to decide whether or not they sign or ratify the Council of Europe &apos;s Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , two main instruments introduced by the Council of Europe .
This is therefore a structured dialogue which gives us an opportunity to exchange views on matters that are of concern to us .
Thirdly , the whole area of sustainability , while protecting and supporting people who are already working is being given protection and now to ensure that they do not lose their jobs in a year or two years &apos; time do not have to undergo a cycle of retraining and improving skills in order to obtain a different job ; maintaining existing jobs that exist .
Madam President , our questions have been formulated in order to highlight the benefits that our citizens can expect from such a package of measures , and what we can offer in such a package .
I voted in favour of this report because it also significantly improves the texts proposed by the European Commission , particularly with regard to the protection of individual personal data .
In the end , we also reviewed unused funds from 2009 , which could have a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy , and a further 420 million for broadband Internet in category II .
Thank you very much for your proposal and for a clear message .
We can also , firstly , see this in the same way as in an attempt to adopt a holistic approach , which is something you have not fully met our expectations yet , but you are on the right track .
Once again , I would like to take the opportunity to thank a Commission that has sometimes been somewhat cumbersome , and the Council , in which we tried to find appropriate solutions during the June sessions and in many trialogue negotiations , because just an hour ago , it approved a reasonable compromise that we reached .
Following the Transport Council meeting on 4 May 2010 , the Commission , together with Eurocontrol , set up a European Air Transport Coordination Package Force .
At the same time , it must be borne in mind that rarely coups create the conditions for illegal trade in timber itself , in this case illegal logging .
In particular , I come from a country , Portugal , and from the region , the Azores , where the dairy sector is of great importance and is firmly rooted in regions that are relatively fragile from a social point of view , and where it would really be vitally important to maintain the quota system after 2015 .
People are not only isolated in isolated cultures , individual cultures are borne by the countryside of the people who have created them .
Some are so good that they deserve to be considered .
( SV ) Mr President , Iceland is a small country with approximately 300 000 inhabitants , but it is a great nation .
Mr President , MEPs must play an important role in controlling health claims .
For this reason , we are expressing our &apos; yes &apos; to the Nabucco project , but we are equally unequivocally supporting our governments &apos; efforts to ensure the diversification of supply , which will guarantee the well-being of our citizens .
Political parties can be banned ; there is corruption in the legal system ; there is a violation of human rights ; there is no freedom of speech and assembly of the same kind as in Britain or in most other European countries .
It is very clear that we need an energy mix comprising from different energy sources on the widest possible basis , because this will stabilise the energy situation , making the full use of the potential of the diversity of each country and of Europe as a whole .
However , I have some doubts when this Parliament is calling for the condemnation of some repetitive practices of international law , because this legal basis is far from clear .
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia , and I am clearly expressing my full support for the Tunisian people and the historic democratic revolution that they have begun .
Furthermore , it calls on Member States to take appropriate measures and effective policies , such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty levels , and to report regularly on their actions to address this problem .
If you get the law through the Hungarian Parliament and decide that only a two-thirds majority can be amended from now on , you know that it will not be easy to amend it again after the next elections .
Universal Customs Preferences ( debate )
Today , we voted in plenary on the question of harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
The issue of new perception of mutual trust presents us with another serious problem .
This year , we have allocated additional resources to the EEAS of EUR 9.5 million , but the real costs can only be evaluated after the first year of activity , when a report will be submitted to the European Parliament on all expenditure relating to the EEAS &apos;s activities .
My question concerns Pakistan , its chronic instability , which we all know is a factor in the crisis for the whole region and for Afghanistan .
Of course , we cannot forget the natural differences that exist between men and women .
We should not forget this when it comes to , for example , excluding the income generated by road charges .
( HU ) Mr President , what I welcome from this directive is a clear definition of patients &apos; rights , the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed resolution of a situation where the experts requested are not available in the patient &apos;s country .
Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , I would like to make a few comments on the issues and questions that have been asked .
Last week , I accused the Belgian Presidency of behaving like a spirit .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran as I am concerned about the constant violations of human rights , particularly with regard to freedom of association , expression and information , and also because I support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people .
The issue of the rapid start of funding will be particularly important .
It is one thing to create such a mechanism , but it must also be accessible and understandable to EU citizens so that they can make full use of it .
The agreement not only makes the Canadian and European markets more competitive .
I do not know if the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) .
Moreover , its private aspect not only improves Europe &apos;s image in the world , but also contributes to promoting European citizenship .
Mr President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , the aim of the proposal we will be examining today is to amend the regulations adopted in 2004 , which contributed to the improvement and greater harmonisation of security measures to protect EU citizens &apos; passports against fraud , while also introducing elements of biometric identification .
Secondly , some kind of temporary institutional framework must be established for the mechanism for implementing decisions .
However , in positive terms , some of the agreements we have negotiated so far are very good , such as the Korea Free Trade Agreement .
It is therefore important for Parliament to draw the Commission &apos;s attention once again to the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will recognise that his current approach to work constructively with the European Union is much more effective than the constant attempts to rewrite history .
Although this may seem strange , the European Commission has , to date , not even the time to apply to the Latvian Government has come to an end discrimination on the basis of language .
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to link any form of assistance to the Pakistani Government with the urgent abolition of this deadly discrimination against religious minorities in that country .
This will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration , organised crime and human trafficking .
This is acceptable and legitimate , and we have fought for this .
It is clear that , more than ever , financial institutions need to stop and reconsider their approach for years .
Our common objective is to minimise the amount of by-catches and discards , and we have achieved this in this committee .
The main objective of the aid for trade is to make these 48 states more competitive on domestic and international markets .
Even if we accept the logic of internalising external costs as a platform , it is ultimately unsustainable if we want to ease traffic jams , penalise heavy goods vehicles and not normal vehicles , as is the case with the old principle of &apos; polluter pays &apos; , which is clearly discriminatory .
I am encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary debate .
Moreover , when we look at the issue of where we start , we have some concerns .
The primary objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States , whether they are centre-right or centre left , is to safeguard the continued profitability of the monopolies by passing the weight of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes throughout the European Union .
Measures should therefore be taken to disseminate best practices and raise awareness among local decision makers of the benefits that ICT offers .
Mr President , we did not hear the interpretation of the previous speech in English .
However , this recast document has one very important aspect which relates to the whole reorganisation of the TEN-T network in the next decade .
- ( LT ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the people of Ukraine , but let us not forget that it is also very important for the people of the European Union , because Ukraine is an important partner for us , particularly when implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe .
Therefore , the Commission must be clear .
We cannot interfere with an issue where the US Government has exclusive competence .
People who care for our forests receive little or nothing to ensure these hidden positions , considered by many as self-evident .
Unfortunately , it must also be said that the list of outstanding issues is being extended rather than decreasing .
In relation to Mr Salafranca &apos;s valuable report on the EU strategy in relations with Latin America , I would like to ask that the Council and the Commission , which is now both personally represented by Baroness Ashton , urgently take action on three issues .
In some Member States , large retailers are strong market positions , but there are also many small retailers who are more satisfied with our current proposal than with the 2002 regulation , because they have had experience that some aspects of it even though the authors were not intended in 2002 but rather made it difficult to resist large business people .
It must establish the European Union &apos;s &apos; Regional Partnership for Peace , Security and Development &apos; , following the adoption of its report in April 2007 , by the Committee on Development .
Over the years and in particular following the historical enlargement in 2004 , the context and ambition of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) have changed greatly .
Spain is taking over the baton of the Presidency of the European Union just when the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force .
In this respect , it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already set out in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and is one of the priorities of the Single Market Act .
I would like to strongly support Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposal .
The Commission &apos;s proposal was amended in accordance with the report under discussion based on the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
It is therefore important that we reach a first-reading agreement .
These people are most in need and should not be excluded because of where they live .
All medical assistance , irrespective of its specific characteristics , falls within the scope of the application of the Treaty establishing the European Union .
However , I would like to draw the House &apos;s attention to the fact that a recent study by the European carological society has demonstrated once again that this methodology has serious constraints , given the low number of women involved in these tests .
It is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , but rather that these agreements should not prevent us from achieving social and environmental targets .
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the use of organic waste in this largely agricultural region and for the data to be verified and a system to exchange best practice to be established .
The perfectly incomprehensible law stipulates that Orthodox priests , bishops and patriarchs must be Turkish citizens .
The most important point of this position adopted by Parliament is what attention has been paid to several measures , which may therefore lack cohesion not only as a set of legislation but , in particular , as regards its implementation .
( RO ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured the European Union &apos;s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
At least the subject of the single digital market has been a breakthrough in the EU &apos;s priorities .
It would represent an important step forward towards transparency , openness and clarity in the European process .
( DE ) Mr President , I support the proposal of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , as it makes no sense to discuss this matter .
Is this the economic model that Europe should propose to Europeans ?
I do not usually allow the people to go beyond the time allotted , but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela &apos;s speech was particularly important to us .
We want a proper strategy based on new technologies , innovation and investment , one which , after its implementation , will actually improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region .
This really is a great success , given that , without considering a legal basis , this directive recognises the undeniable rights of patients and opens up a new range of opportunities for accessing better treatment .
Year after year , the Court of Auditors did not convince us that the EU budget was spent legally and properly and , when I was the main accounts of the European Commission in 2002 , I was really concerned about the lack of control over taxpayers &apos; money .
This is a huge challenge and a great honour for me .
If we are to be honest , we need to recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and that our emissions are still several times higher than those in China or India , for example .
I am sure that the dialogue that will come into being will be constructive .
Therefore , as with Europol , we regret the haste to protect fundamental freedoms .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal to provide an additional simplified method for using European Social Fund funds to ensure that it can respond more quickly and effectively to the economic and social problems facing Europe .
Frankly , I should have voted against the proposed composition of the Commission but , apart from the weak candidates mentioned , there were also some very good ones - including the Polish candidate Janusz Lewandowski .
President of the Commission . - You are very kind , Mr Kirkhope , but there are also 26 other Member States in the European Union apart from Britain , so you will understand that , while we are very concerned about the concerns that you have expressed , we also have to listen to other justified concerns .
In this regard , I think we need to be careful to maintain the neutrality of EU humanitarian measures , although this is sometimes difficult in crisis areas .
The resolution introduces new claims on those already made by Parliament , such as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the Commission , to assess the findings of the investigations and then inform Parliament , reiterating the need for full monitoring by the EU and the Member States in terms of the responsibility and credibility of the follow-up to NGOs , including the follow-up to the Goldstone report .
I also hope that this decision will help save endangered species of fish .
I hope that you will not see my questions as provocation , but as a help in reflecting on this problem .
I am always willing - and will hopefully - to come and explain our findings , but we have to check what we find out .
This result will strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating position in international trade talks , particularly the Doha negotiations under way at the World Trade Organisation .
If Europe speaks with one voice , then the United States will also accept the same goal .
For this reason , I personally support the prices imposed on European tobacco growers at least until the people of Europe smoke .
Looking at the initiatives taken by the various Member States , it is very clear that some countries are taking this problem more seriously than others .
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund ( ESF ) which is separate from European structural policy .
The number of newly infected patients exceeds the area of treatment that , in 2009 , did not receive two thirds of the people who needed it , which means that 10 million people in need did not have access to desirable effective treatment .
If the dignity of a person is indeed recognised , we are not looking at minorities in any way .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s proposals for simplifying this fund .
All EU institutions should ensure in future that our budgets focus on helping individuals and businesses in difficult economic conditions and on the recovery plan .
The quickest way to unblock them , much more effective and efficient than all measures taken from above is to support civil initiatives , cultural organisations and regional institutions in their activities .
Anyone who is struggling today with this treaty in a misconception that it is a treaty that strengthens the influence of the European Union would say : those who are fighting this treaty actually strengthen our so-called partners or , if you like , our counterparts .
The ties of capitalism are opening up the European Union and we are all left with this link .
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting where the Commission will promote the development of a network of other modes of transport .
You might remember that it was a sharp struggle , because it was only the Court of Justice , and the Commission - I have to pay tribute to the Commission - acted clearly at that time with greater logic than the Council and we fully supported the Commission .
The first one to take the floor this morning was Mr Madlener .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski &apos;s report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
( DE ) Mr President , the intentions of the governments of the main EU Member States , the European Commission and the European Central Bank can be recognised easily .
I would like to remind the House that , according to the last number , there are more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union - a figure that is most likely to reach 25 million now - which means that the attraction of more asylum seekers is , in fact , a kind of collective suicide .
Sanctions must be imposed on the Commission , not on the finance ministers .
The economic recovery of Sri Lanka is dependent on direct foreign investment and EU economic support .
We fully support the TBVI objective , but we could not support a point that refers to other parliamentary votes , in which support was expressed , among other things , for abortion , and which contradicts previous explanations of vote recorded in Parliament .
This document is the result of a compromise that has been reached after long negotiations , improving the application of passenger rights while , at the same time , not imposing additional burdens on carriers .
It is certainly high time that the EMU ( Economic and Monetary Union ) swaps a final step in the integration of European economic policy .
I have taken the issue of children &apos;s rights seriously in external relations .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union has been trying to equip itself with legal instruments for economic immigration for 10 years .
Mrs Stihler &apos;s report is a valuable tool to remove the national administrative and technical barriers preventing the marketing of construction products within the European Union and to further develop the single market in this sector .
I think that if we really want to follow the objectives that we set out in the treaties for our foreign policy , we still have a long way to go before we can send back illegal migrants to Libya in the EU .
That is why I supported the resolution on the European Partnership for Innovation under the Innovation Union flagship initiative , and I think we should all be involved in innovation because , as I said , it is crucial for the future .
In the UK , we have a newly elected government that has made promises in this area .
The next item is the report by Mr Alves , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 247 / 2006 establishing specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255 / 2009 - .
Economic crises and environmental policy can go hand in hand and will bring us positive results for the environment and for new jobs .
Some countries will not use all the funds allocated to them from the ESF , and 30 % of them will not be used at all .
That strikes me for saying that , although the Commission maintains that it has information and publishes it , there is even a duty to publish it - that this information , for example , has not been published .
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I strongly support the proposal to organise an effective information campaign for JKM visibility .
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and wants the implementation of the economic policy objectives to be binding .
I voted today in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation with regard to unitary patent protection , as I believe that blocking within the Council on account of the language regime is unjustified .
I repeat : the treaty makes it clear that a Member State cannot be forced to take over debts .
I would like to remind you of the joint agreement between the European Parliament and the Council to designate 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
Let me assure this House that we will continue to raise these issues at the highest level and we will remember the international human rights obligations to which the People &apos;s Republic of China has committed .
I hope - and I am very confident - that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement .
Firstly , it is a pity that my colleague , Commissioner McCreevy , is not here - I think that we have perhaps started the downstream !
You may not know about this , but we need extensive animal testing to verify these claims , for example .
What causes me a little doubt , Commissioner , is the considerable influence of the CARS 21 group and the influence of the car industry in the process that is started here .
We disagree with this .
Aid from the EU planned for the 2007-2010 period , which is intended to encourage the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova , amounts to more than EUR 50 million .
Of course , we cannot understand how an illegal worker will go to work , and the person who will accept it to cover the cost of housing and life is ultimately punished .
I believe that this measuring system based on the affirmation of different parameters will result in political decisions which generally satisfy the needs of society and the economy in general .
At the same time , I would like to stress that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on an end to the restrictions on freedom and violence perpetrated by non-violent demonstrations and human rights defenders , while also being directly linked to these conditions .
Finally , High Representative , go down the road to the Middle East .
It is all the more so since the United States Congress passed a law to protect members of the American army one month after the International Criminal Tribunal began operating in June 2002 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I just want to explain briefly that this report contains amendments which were adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following the resolution adopted in this plenary on 19 June 2008 , which aimed at authorising the marketing of poultry meat , even after anti-microtreatment was carried out .
Madam President , first of all , I wish to express my deep sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deepest concern about the further four Cuban prisoners and one opposition activist who , in protest , have themselves launched hunger strike .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme for 2010-2014 relating to the area of freedom , security and justice ( Stockholm Programme ) .
Our motto should be &apos; not waste a single cent &apos; .
The Union and , in particular , the Mediterranean countries , have always been destroyed in providing humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people , because the principle of solidarity towards the people living in such circumstances and conditions is fundamental .
Workers themselves are often isolated and , in this situation , access to trade unions is very difficult .
( Laughter and applause )
Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank the Commissioner and the Commissioner and the Commission for their comments today .
However , the current text of Mrs Guillaume &apos;s report , despite some of the amendments that have improved it in part , calls directly for abuse of the asylum procedure , which will lead to the blocking of the relevant services , which are therefore accepted by applicants who need to be reviewed quickly .
I would like to thank the authors , Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their excellent work , for which we all benefit .
We did indeed have a very ambitious programme with some extensive , important reports .
So-called social dumping poses a great danger to workers , as it fundamentally undermines their rights .
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo .
( EL ) Madam President , in relation to what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of any proposal , I should like to ask whether , based on the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation , a preliminary study can be carried out for the area in question , taking into account its specific nature , so that there are criteria which each State will have to take into account and implement from the outset .
We also need to address the issue of Roma women , who are particularly suffering from poverty , reduced access to housing , discrimination and violence ; and also the problem of young Roma , because their lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to access employment during the economic crisis .
I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund , which extends the eligibility of its interventions in housing , which should help marginalised communities in all Member States .
It is also a reminder to all political decision makers in their area of competence that public authorities actually have a role to play in terms of freedom of expression and must be ready to promote its development .
Mr President , I believe that the European Union is already too large , combining too many cultures , and I simply do not trust this system at all and it will be worse .
It is a little bit too early to announce the results of these analyses and , as the honourable Member is aware , any move in this process requires unanimity in the Council .
It is important to realise that the prospects for integration into the EU are the strongest incentive for the Balkan countries to carry out the necessary reforms and also serve as a factor of the stability of the entire region .
At a time when advertising plays an increasing role , it is essential that we define criteria that enable consumers and patients to obtain accurate information on the effects of this medicinal resource .
Neither did Armstrong say , it would be a small step for the European funds , but a big leap for the European economy .
Thirdly , security deficiencies , which people have repeatedly stated will simply not exist if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement .
In addition , the rapid spread of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years have caused an increase in online gambling resources and consequently the emergence of cross-border issues which are still not solved .
All people who make decisions in this area should have the same access to expert information about the country of origin of applicants and bodies eligible to debate appeals , and this information should also be provided to persons seeking asylum .
For all these years , I therefore appreciate what significant progress has been made , creating a single world multinational parliament , elected by universal suffrage law .
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion a year on defence , and these EUR 200 billion must be better spent than was the case in the past .
Together , we have changed something .
In addition , we will work on services of general interest during the current parliamentary term .
I would therefore like to suggest that we allow Mr Almunia , the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs , for example , to do this task , because he was critical of many countries during his term of office and then there was a problem with Greece .
In this regard , there is a huge need for reform in Turkey .
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries , particularly Spain and Portugal , so we should now grant this aid to Lithuania .
Security of spent fuel and radioactive waste management ( debate )
I will mention only the most recent cases , such as the removal of the cathbles in Vinh Long , which was replaced by public park , or the establishment of the organised police and troops in the wreck of Panny Me from the Catholic Hanoi software .
Moreover , this fund plays an important role in relation to worker education , lifelong learning , improving jobs and integrating workers in the labour market .
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law ( announcement of motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
For this reason , I am voting in favour of rejecting the Commission &apos;s proposal .
This has now happened , and I supported this proposal in the vote .
That is just one answer : growth .
