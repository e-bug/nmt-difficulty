This report is the result of a compromise, since nothing more has been tabled, no less than 1 625 amendments to it, and it is divided into a series of key points covering the causes of the crisis, from the property bubble to unguaranteed banking products, a lack of tax harmonisation at European level and a breach of the Stability and Growth Pact.

It is an important step in supporting families with children, enabling them to reduce unfair tax burdens.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by this debate by fellow Members, who, on the one hand, speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but on the other hand, when it comes to taking the first step with regard to micro-enterprises - and it is exclusively these that we are talking about today and not about any other - are already tempted to say'no' once again.

In another place, it regrets the fact that Europe has an ageing population.
I believe that we, as Parliament, must seek more dynamic decisions in response to the problems faced by Europe, without ever forgetting about transparency in the management of funds.

(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, the level of interest in this debate with the questioners is visible from the fact that neither one of them is in the Chamber, so they will not have heard what Mrs Vaidere has just said - that real visa policy in Russia was a weapon used by that country not to foster the naturalisation process in Latvia but to achieve precisely the opposite.

It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability, for example.
This kind of cooperation greatly simplifies the life of a rapporteur.

To conclude, we have enormous challenges ahead of us to ensure unity at European level, to involve strategically external partners, and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate measures, but there are many lessons to be learnt from COP 15.

Any new balicious and unfounded political attacks will be redundant.
In this regard, Europe's approach could be'yes', of course we need external supply, we need security of supply and major innovative projects such as Desertec, but we must also ensure that citizens, businesses and households, can have greater control over their energy budgets and their energy consumption in terms of price, economy and the environment'.
For these reasons, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the proposals calling for an environmental impact study and will vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr Sturdy - which I myself have signed - relating to endocrine disruptors, as well as those which support the provision of plant protection products in the event of an emergency.

Europe has been involved in the region for some time: EUR 300 million per year in Afghanistan, the EUPOL mission, which is undertaking extremely valuable action despite its personnel problems, the international observation mission and, of course, the involvement of the different ISAF states.
That is one thing.
Another measure is needed is for India to establish and apply clear and transparent public procurement regulations, which will also help European companies to be able to access them.
Thus, with an adequate impact assessment and the formulation of the different legal alternatives, as well as a clear definition of the objectives and funding of European infrastructure, long-term strategic projects for building a stronger EU will be easier to achieve.
Part of this is the ratification of the new START Treaty, which is still pending in the United States Congress.

Mrs Ronzulli, I ask you to sit down and stop talking.

Georgia's territorial integrity must remain out of the question.

Today, I would like to thank Presidents Borrell and Pöttering and Parliament's Committee on Petitions for supporting Michael's campaign to do justice.

If we were in the former Romanian senate, surely a senator would get up with his toolbox and look at President Trichet, would say:'How dare you dare to abuse and Trichete, trichete, a notes?' - how long are you going to continue to prove our patience, Mr Trichet?
Finally, Mr President, if you will allow me, in order to remove any suspicion that may exist, I would like to propose that a European Parliament enquiry committee be established on this issue.
The service concessions have been deliberately eliminated from the procurement directives in order to ensure greater flexibility in these areas and to take into account cultural differences.
I agree with some of the other ideas that have been expressed, but in my opinion it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and understandable.
I think this could be very useful, but it is not working effectively at the moment, nor is it making full use of its potential.
It is, of course, true that EPAs are different to the Lomé and Cotonou Convention that has substantiated the Union's relations with ACP countries for 30 years, but unilateral preferences that characterise these conventions have become contested at the World Trade Organisation by other developing countries.
However, while we fully support the integration of the Roma population into the European Union, we have serious doubts as regards EU intervention on issues that we consider to be attributions of individual nation states, such as access to healthcare, education, employment and housing.
It is also essential to give priority to food security, agriculture, infrastructure, capacity building and, in particular, to economic growth, access to technologies, as well as to human and social development in the least developed countries.
We cannot continue down this path.
The ultimate objective is to improve the implementation of EU law and therefore to healthier animals and decent living conditions.
What measures do you intend to take to encourage rich countries to contribute to the cost of this crisis?
We also need to focus on best practice, because the Slovene authorities, for example, are careful to follow the vehicles that cross their territory.

This report is frightening in what shows by the behaviour of this Parliament.
accuracy in organising projects, efficiency in the use of resources, and clarity in their duration,

However, we must honour our commitment to climate change: everyone recognises that we are world leaders on this issue.
rapporteur. - Madam President, you have caught me a little unforeseen, as you do not know the radical change in the agenda, but I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak to the House of a very important sector in the area of financial services, which is that of direct and reinsurance, of our work on the Solvency II report and how we now finally present to Parliament for a very specific European regulation, in order to establish a platform.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to go to 30%, and I will conclude by quoting Barack Obama when he says that we can deliver the jobs of the future to our competitors or we can, as they have already started to do, grasp the opportunity of the century.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make four observations.
For this reason, several colleagues and myself have invited to speak here tomorrow, a expert who has invested the trade in organs and the deliberate killing of people in China in order to obtain organs for transplant purposes.

These initiatives, facilitated by EU funds, ensure that our efforts are brought together in concrete work on specific projects and specific programmes which will mobilise each institution's own capabilities and, as such, are an excellent way of developing our joint action.

The EIB can, and should, play an important role in managing recent events in the Mediterranean.
I therefore support the demand for an investigation into the distribution of profit margins in the production and distribution chain.
However, if you place the'polluter pays' principle forever, and I am ready to discuss this with you, then it is the Member States that cause congestion because they do not have sufficient infrastructure.

(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following observation: what is striking is that, although the growth indicators in Albania continue to rise continually, with growth exceeding 2% in 2010, in the midst of global economic instability, and reaching a figure of 3% in 2011, social tension continues to get worse, however.
Human trafficking remains a serious problem in the European Union.
There are also other issues that I would also emphasise, echoing what Mr Paparizov said.
In South Sudan, the EU has an important contribution to make to stabilisation, development and the creation of institutional capabilities.
As the Commissioner said, we need to implement the 13th Constitution in Sri Lanka, which provides for decentralisation towards regional administration by the population there, and the EU can provide valuable help in this regard.
However, I will say once again, there may be differences of opinion, and there are differences between the Commission and the Council and also between a few Members of this Parliament on the regulations of maritime and inland transport; there are those who prefer separate legislation for inland and maritime transport.
I support the underlying grounds for this proposal, namely, the need to define a coherent and comprehensive framework for developing investments in energy infrastructure in the EU, which will enable the Commission to monitor the progress of investment projects in the energy sector.

The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are properly applied in the country and that the level of corruption continues to decline and that those in public posts who abuse their position are punished with severity.
In short, the Europe we are striving for - of justice and social progress, of economic and social cohesion, of cooperation between sovereign states and equal rights and promoting peace - is far from being achieved by the guidelines that this Commission is proposing to follow.
From the point of view of democracy and legitimacy, it is important to communicate to our citizens what the EU does.
We Germans would not be doing justice to our national unity if we did not see it as a contribution to the unity of Europe, following the historic events that I hugely repopulated here.
To explain in a simpler way, we have the same person performing the functions of Mr Solana and Mr Ferrero-Waldner.
As I said on a previous occasion in this Chamber, I am an advocate of a Europe of nations that cooperate.
- Report: Elles

(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we will be voting on the Kirilov report in the coming weeks and I welcome this, as this is an urgent need.

I propose that a study be carried out on consolidated accounts.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a general comment and then ask two or three questions depending on the time I have.

I also call on the Commission to take concrete measures and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe.
Madam President, I think, once again, this is one of those reports that many can applaud.

Europe cannot be the sum of 27 national interests alone.
In the meantime, Mr Reinfeldt will present the report on the last half of the European Council's activity.
The negative side of austerity measures, which will leave working people out of work without jobs in the public sector, must be turned into an advantage for the businesses starting business, taking advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit by reducing the initial costs for businesses so that they can create the lucrative private sector that is required to remove all our countries from the gap we now find ourselves in.
Both entities have failed to develop a shared vision, which has led to stagnation of the process.
Is this free trade agreement ultimately only suited to the world and to the division of economic power that we have seen today between Europe and India, or is this agreement still in ten or fifteen years' time?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access throughout the EU by 2013 and fast Internet connections by 2020.
The economic crisis in Moldova is not just a consequence of the global crisis, but is, above all, due to a lack of immediate measures that were needed when the crisis broke out in the Republic of Moldova.
European workers and the poor in Europe must mobilise their power against these disastrous policies and for a truly democratic and socialist Europe, which means opposing the policies of this new EU Commission.
The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Animal welfare requirements are now officially included in the Treaty on European Union and consideration must be taken when designing policies for other sectors such as the internal market.

Many errors and one charge: the euro.
Bearing in mind the initiatives I have just described, I feel there is now a solid basis on which we can improve our fisheries and aquaculture sectors, with innovative research under a framework programme.
We are conducting this debate in a far too technocratic way.
I therefore congratulate Millán Mon on his brilliant report, which is now at an optimum time for strengthening relations between the two continents.
That is why we move forward with an important simplification of EU legislation.
Unfortunately, important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected and, as a result, initiatives cannot be signed by residents of the EU who are not nationals of a Member State, thereby preventing the equal participation of residents, regardless of nationality, and there is no guarantee that signatures will meet the numbers of signatories.
I call for the creation of an independent committee formed by local and international legal experts to conduct investigations and prosecute the violent events following the problematic elections in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan.
All of this has gone too far and it must finish.
The drafting of a guide for public and private operators and the creation of a system of training and mobility on how to implement multi-level governance policies in practice could be effective measures aimed at improving regional policy.
I hope that our Spanish and Italian colleagues will be involved, but we cannot leave this matter waiting any longer because the world looks for the innovation market.
Furthermore, I believe that we have an obligation to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies, starting with the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), take due account of them.
Mr President, the ongoing negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam should also include respect for human rights and civil liberties.
Without prejudice to the adoption of some important measures proposed in this report, I would like to draw attention here to a key issue in this problem.
However, the method will not subject the economy and jobs to bureaucracy, unfair competition or unforeseen price fluctuations.
This should not have an adverse effect on the cod populations, as the catches of cod are very small at the moment.
The proposed sanctions are balanced and necessary, and they are expected to be deterrent from the less correct trading practices that have been adopted by trade agents.
This criterion is, in my opinion, destitute and discriminatory since, as in Portugal, the majority of these families live in rural areas in shelter.

Above all, the rapporteur regrets that citizens disregard the rights that this citizenship gives them.
While the construction of an area of security, justice and freedom within the European Union is an imperative for all of us, and undoubtedly also a model of European democracy to be built, and many of us believe that Europol represents an instrument that can be adapted to it, all of us defend that the placing in common of the means - namely, of human rights, but especially of technical means, which is to combat organised crime and all kinds of European security - with the greatest rigour of European citizens' rights.
It is therefore essential for measures to be adopted which can enhance guarantees of independence and transparency in impact assessments, and this will contribute to the fact that this instrument can play its full part in helping the process of political decision making and ensure the quality and adequacy of the activities of the Community institutions.
Secondly, the strategy must strengthen the internal cohesion of the EU, in other words its convergence.
It is not, I might add, the direction in which the Commission was taking, as the Commission's proposal focused - through the regulation that this House adopted - on reform of the current system of agencies, which are private, and on the very strict consolidation of transparency requirements to avoid conflicts of interest, honesty of credit rating.
The European Commission is also called on to assess the costs and benefits of establishing a completely independent European Credit Rating Foundation.
Even before the crisis we are facing today, the Member States of the European Union were already faced with the social problems resulting from weak economic growth, from a complicated demographic situation and the difficulties involved in inviting an increasingly globalised world economy.
However, there is reason for concern that the Moldovan enthusiasm will fall.
In this Parliament, we have always taken a strong position in defence of the right to autonomy of the people of Tibet, which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence.

Against this background, it is important to introduce a system for monitoring and inspecting medicines, which will provide patients with reliable information.

These costs will, however, be subject to a few exceptions, provided that the Member State requires them to be duly justified.
This framework decision should not lead to excessive bureaucracy where, for the problems in question, there are already other options.
The ECB was not able to predict the triggering of a large-scale crisis, nor has it been a brilliant action on regulation, which is far from perfect.
However, as a serious organisation, the European Union should be better prepared for these situations and should, in particular, be prepared to react efficiently in urgent cases.
- Report: Kaczmarek
We should therefore only support their inclusion if such measures are not effective.
I have committed myself to informing the European institutions of this civil protest action.
The EU and the industrialised nations should adopt a target of a reduction of between 25% and 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and, in the long term, should aim to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels.
Report: Maria in Céu Patrão Neves
I would like to refer more specifically to two outstanding issues which were referred to several times during the debate.
First of all, and on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for its cooperation and spirit of compromise that have enabled us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of EU bus and coach passengers, especially with regard to disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility.
One of the reasons for this is the fragmentation of our defence equipment market.
Earlier at the beginning of this period, the subject of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy is an important point.
The creation of the EEAS will require a variety of decisions, including probably amendments to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations, both of which require a proposal from the Commission and its adoption in codecision.

in writing. - The situation throughout North Africa is certainly dangerous, but also gives hope.
Coordination requires continued improvement, and Member States' responsibility in this area should certainly be increased.
The Irish people, with their very strong vote, are looking forward to continuing to thrive and build a strong Europe and, above all, a federal Europe.
Although the protection of the environment and the safeguarding of public health are inseparable, I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers.
It is a bravery that we should resolve together.
We need to combine our efforts with the major consumer countries, such as the US, China, Russia and Japan, to tackle this problem and create a global alert system and registering of illegal holdings and countries which raise concern, using Interpol, a suitable UN body, with the support of the most advanced satellite detection systems.
Of course, we cannot allow short-term support for the industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness.
I would like to say that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
in writing. - (PT) The fight against unemployment and social exclusion has been given special attention by citizens and the European institutions, due to the effects of the current economic and social crisis.
This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to say that I think this issue is too important for us to continue to live in the lifetime we have been living in Europe.
As has been pointed out, we clearly did not know the names of the candidates and there was no woman among them, although we should recognise, by all due respect to Commissioner Barnier, that he has provided us with a valid explanation for that.
We regret the rate of abstention in the European elections and vote'no' in referendums.
We have to ask what is happening and we will inform you, Mr Coelho.
(PL) Mr President, horizontal agreements are regulated by a variety of regulations, but omissions in legislative, intentional or non-, provisions can lead to the elimination of competition.
We also need a European asylum system that is more effective and contains more protective measures.
That concludes Question Time.
I notice, moreover, that you are all very keen to engage in police cooperation which, of course, respects human rights and is in keeping to the values of the European Union.
The same horror as Picasso painted in his Guernica, representing our village from Guernica razed by the Junkers of Condor Legion seven decades ago.
In this regard, speculators also try to speculate on a negative economic situation and sometimes aggravate it.
Mr Bové is quite right and Mr Fajmon is deeply...
It is important to promote not only the competitiveness of our agricultural sector, but also traditional agriculture, organic farming and local distribution, and to ensure the diversity of agriculture throughout Europe.
The Rapkay report on the amendment of the Staff Regulations of the European Community in the context of the installation of the European External Action Service, the EEAS, is a document of great relevance in the creation of a Union foreign policy.
We therefore consider - and we will debate it again at first reading - that initial expenditure should reflect our priority, and we agree with the emphasis that the rapporteur places on the issues of multilingualism and buildings, which we have always given great priority, but in terms of emphasising legislation.
author. - (PT) A few weeks ago, I had the honour of chairing a delegation from the Committee on International Trade in this European Parliament which attended the seventh seventh Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.
With this in mind, Europe will be able to make headway.
I asked the Member States to give me names, including women.
Firstly, it is essential to maintain a geographical separation from financial aid for countries in the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries, in line with the provisions of the financial perspective for 2007-2013, and also to continue to support these countries in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank.
We believe that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that its independence has not been recognised by Spain or by four other EU Member States.
These are reasons enough not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU summit in response to calls from the Belarusian opposition.
It is a very important approach to the real humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market.
Mr President, I would also like to support what my fellow Members have said about the rights of disabled passengers, what Mrs Kadenbach said about minors, about the reference to the issue of fire security, specifically about the safety of the aspersion system in all EU hotels and the need for a new proposal to follow.
I was also going to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission and would therefore take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Ashton on her appointment.
The report makes it clear that national defence and security are areas of the exclusive authority of the Member States, which we consider important to emphasise.
Previously, the Member States most concerned about asset stripping and illegal purchases were those with no lower threshold of disclosure of participations and no disclosure of gainful contracts.
I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Lehne, for his approach.
In other words, the Copenhagen Agreement contains references to the level of ambition that will be required to combat climate change in the climate change agreement post-2012 and lays the basis for a financial package, and calls for serious commitments to be made with regard to reducing emissions.
Knowing, malaria and tuberculosis still clash around four million lives per year.
From a more strictly commercial point of view, I would like to ask the Commissioner for assurances that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) cannot be used to prevent the trade in medicines that are accessible at more competitive prices; safe medicines, generic medicines that do not violate copyright and whose only crime is that of being produced by emerging countries such as India and Brazil and that may disrupt Western pharmaceutical industries.
Nevertheless, Members have the right to say a word.
This is unacceptable!
We want to be involved in this process.
That is why we will have to find the appropriate level of financial and technological compensation.
This is also an area where we can take more robust measures in the context of competition and consumer protection policies.
It is also outrageous that these politicians demand that we accept the result of the second referendum, when they have not accepted the result of the first one.
As the co-author of the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the situation in Kyrgyzstan, I would like to thank my fellow Members who voted today in favour of this document.
I will conclude, Mr President, Minister, with a proposal for future generations.
The establishment of clear rules and objectives for the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment is absolutely central to the sustainable consolidation of the internal market and to better environmental quality in the European Union, as well as for the recovery of strategic raw materials.
The Heads of State or Government have also emphasised that nuclear safety should not be limited to the territory of the European Union, but that we will also ask our neighbours to carry out these stress tests.
A very clear distinction must be maintained between the powers of the military authorities and those of the humanitarian bodies, and dialogue between them is needed in order to promote mutual understanding.
The Commission continues to work towards a more systematic assessment of the quality of public finances, including results-based budgeting aspects.
This will be a priority for me as Trade Commissioner.
The Commission could therefore put forward amended or new proposals depending on the situation.
The United States must define clear and transparent criteria to refuse visas in certain Member States.
This is the issue of funding that remains open.
To the other Members of this Parliament, I would say that we need to criticise Turkey constructively, and we ourselves are worthy of criticism.
Studies have shown that profits resulting from human trafficking exceed the profits derived from smuggling and trade in drugs.
Farmers in my part of the world feel completely abandoned and frankly insulted by the fact that some Members assume that they do not know what they do and that they need to be taught.

I therefore voted in favour of this resolution; considering the negative impact of market liberalisation on local economies, it underlines the strategic importance of reasonable customs protection.
I am generally voting in favour of the proposals aimed at relaunching the European economy through greater financial support for energy projects presented in this report.
Therefore, the report on the European Refugee Fund, advocating, as it does, the resettlement of refugees in the European Union, is quite incomprehensible.
This is an estimate which could increase.
Economists use mathematic models to highlight the value of domestic work.
Only when we are fully informed about such cases will we be able to talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law.
I repeat: from all means.
It is also particularly urgent on the eve of the Copenhagen conference that both the EU and the other international players combine their policies on international trade, climate change, humanitarian aid and development.
I would like to make a reference to Commissioner Rehn's statement, for whom I have a personal regard, which said that Nigeria is a very poor country: that is not true - Nigeria is a very rich country that is the victim of a corrupt and inept class that has squandered the country's resources, leaving millions of citizens in poverty.
Finally, Mr Mölzer, not so pessimistic, is what I want to say to you.
I therefore call on the Council to express its opinion without delay on Parliament's new proposal so that ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010 and I call on the Commission to ensure mutual respect for the social and environmental requirements of the producing and exporting countries outside the ACP region.
This requires the Commission - as coordinator of the Energy Community - to take Ukraine in arms and to remind you of its obligations when security of Europe's supply is at stake.
We regret, of course, the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes, regardless of whether atrocities are committed in Europe or, for example, in the former European colonies.
The main objective of the regulation must be to create a new collective monitoring and responsibility culture, rather than to impose a bureaucratic and onerous process on each product.
Member of the Commission. - The current EU competition policy for vertical agreements is quite favourable to Internet sales, and I am sure you know that, Mr President.
In contrast, the report contains clear recommendations on the second and third of the mistake, and they are going in the right direction.
In the area of transport, far more efforts will be needed to impose restrictions on vehicle manufacturers to bring cars with a more efficient fuel consumption.
The financial situation in some eurozone countries, which has been analysed today, clearly shows the risks of removal from the Stability and Growth Pact agreements.
Therefore, I think it would be very sensible for us to look at how we can best use the financial resources saving in order to broaden the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and, presumably, necessary financial instrument to support the development of specific energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.
In the Commission and Parliament we deliberately chose not to raise the issue of the process of funding, because we are assuming that the sector will keep its promise to address this issue of free and spontaneous freedom without legislative pressure.
This brings me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy.
(EL) Madam President, as regards the processing industry, I should remind the House that Pakistan is the world's fourth cotton producer, with 9% of global production, followed by the European Union, with a little less than 5.5%.
Therefore, the Council and, above all, this Parliament are also involved in the decision on the College's composition, the portfolios that I have redistributed and the programme you have presented for the next five years.
We have to understand that things have only been working for a year and that the pace should speed up in 2009.
Of course, this is reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese population because the country has already entered into recession and the workers and people are living in ever-worse, inequalities are getting worse and poverty is also worsening.
These objectives, President of the Commission and President of the Council, have already been formulated in the 2020 targets.
We have already worked with many Arab countries on initiatives to receive gas from Turkey, hopefully, to Nabucco.

According to the report of the UN Working Group, the victims of trafficking come from different social contexts, the wealthiest of the poorest, the most educated in academic terms to completely ancient women, from children to older women.

I think that mutual recognition of medical revenue among Member States is very important because this is not only about healthcare, it is also about rehabilitation, but we have a time when it is possible to finalise that detail.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the INTA Committee for these reports, which raise important issues regarding the contribution of the European Union's trade policy to the achievement of some of the key objectives of public policies: respect for human rights, the pursuit of economic welfare and social justice, the pursuit of sustainable growth and respect for the environment and, in particular, for the climate system.

Everyone seems to forget the contribution made by the United States and, of course, NATO, to peace in Europe.
I think we should consider this as an appropriate opportunity to address something that Europe urgently needs: economic growth, jobs, a sector of dynamic businesses, more innovation, more efficient public procurement; it is on the basis of these things that our citizens will judge.
I think it is not our job to make predictions about the possible developments in those countries.
The second draft involves concessions.
Madam President, Ireland adopted a ban on smoking in the workplace during the European elections in 2004, so we met many sister-rich constituents behind the back door.

Therefore, as agreed with the Council, the following text should be added at the end of Article 1 (4) of the original version of the regulation, pursuant to Article 1 (2) (b) of this regulation:'Every time the charges are referred to in other currencies of non-euro, the annual review of the tariffs regulated by Articles 4 (a), 4 (a) (a) (b) (a) (a) (a) exchange rate) will be carried out by the same toolbox 3).

Madam President, our questions have been asked in order to highlight the benefits our citizens will be able to expect from this package of measures and what we can offer within it.

In addition, we have carried out a review of unused funds from 2009, which indicates that a total of EUR 1.9 billion can be activated for energy and EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II.

We also see a little of this in the text and an attempt to take the holistic approach, an aspect that was not exactly how we imagine, but which nevertheless goes in the right direction.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which was sometimes a little tougher, and the Council, where we tried to find reasonable solutions in night sessions and in multiple trialogue sessions, because they also approved the reasonable compromise that we reached a moment ago.

Last week in committee, I deployed the Belgian Presidency as a ghost presidency.

One thing is to establish such a mechanism and another one is that it must be accessible and comprehensible for EU citizens so that they can use it in full.

I also hope that Belgrade understands that its current approach towards constructive work with the European Union is by far more effective than ever trying to rewrite history.
However ridiculous the European Commission may seem to be unable to find the necessary arguments so far, nor has it taken the time to influence the Latvian Government on ending discrimination on the basis of language.

Even by accepting the rationality of internalisation of external costs as a valid starting point, it is untenable that, with the aim of mitigating transit congestion, only heavy goods vehicles and not light vehicles, as well as the old'polluter pays' principle being punished in a clearly discriminatory way.
The understanding and support expressed in this debate are an incentive for me.
Furthermore, when we look at the starting point, we have some concerns.

Year after year, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us the satisfaction that the European Union budget is spent regularly and in compliance with the law; indeed, the lack of control over taxpayers' money was a major cause for concern to me when I led the European Commission's accounting service in 2002.
For me, this is both a huge challenge and a great honour.

I also hope that this decision will help to rescue endangered species.
I hope that I regard my questions as not as a provocation, but as a help for reflection.

We will soon have a TEN-T meeting, in which the Commission will move towards the development of a network in other modes of transport.

Mr President, I think that the European Union has become too great, has too many cultures and I simply do not have anything faith in this system; it is going to be worse still.
