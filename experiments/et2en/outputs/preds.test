While I would very much like to express my solidarity with the victims' families and with all those affected, and my support for local advisers, I would like to use this forum to address the European Community, because it has to be said that this situation requires European response and, first and foremost, European solidarity.

The report on Parliament's behaviour is appalling.

rapporteur. - Madam President, you helped me a little unexpectedly because I did not notice a complete change to today's schedule, but I am very grateful for the opportunity to address this House on a very important issue of financial services, that is, of talking about insurance and reinsurance, which we have done with the Solvency II report and how we have now finally given it to Parliament, so that we can establish a very strong basis for regulation across the European Union.

From the point of view of democracy and legality, it is important to inform our citizens what the European Union is doing.
We Germans would not be fair in our national unity if we did not see it as a contribution to European unity following the historic events that I have described.
To put it plainly, one person is doing the job both of Javier Solana and of Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
As I said last time in this House, I will stand with you with my full vigour to see a Europe of peoples working together.

Unfortunately, important amendments have been rejected by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and, as a result, the initiative cannot be signed by those residents of the EU who are not nationals of the Member States who are not nationals of the Member States, irrespective of their nationality, and there is no guarantee that signatures will comply with the number of signatories.

Although it is of paramount importance to all of us in the European Union to create an area of freedom, security and justice, which is, without doubt, one example of the democratic European model that we are developing, and although for many of us, Europol is an instrument that can be adapted, we still attach importance to ensuring that the rights of resources - organised crime and all forms of trafficking are protected, above all, human resources - and also technical resources - the most important part of all, that of which we have to ensure that we have European citizens' rights, namely, namely, namely, namely, namely, the greatest possible control and the greatest possible limitation and security of the rights of all of all our citizens' rights in terms of Europe.
For this reason, it is vital to implement measures which can strengthen guarantees that impact assessments are transparent and independent, as this will help maximise the role of the instrument as a means of decision making and a guarantee of the quality and compatibility of the activities of the EU institutions.
My second point is that the strategy should strengthen internal cohesion in the EU, in other words its approach.
I would add that the Commission did not intend to move in this direction, because the Commission's proposal was focused, through the regulation adopted by the European Parliament, on reforming the current system of private agencies and on strengthening transparency requirements in order to avoid problems relating to the integrity of conflicts of interest and credit rating.
It also calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of creating a completely independent European Credit Rating Foundation.

From a strictly commercial point of view, I would like to ask the Commissioner for his reassurance that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) cannot be used to prevent medicines from being sold at more competitive prices; safe, generic medicines that do not violate copyright; the only crime of which is that they are produced in developing countries, such as India and Brazil, and that they may be produced in the West pharmaceutical industry.

I believe that we should treat this as a suitable code of conduct that Europe desperately needs: growth, jobs, a dynamic small enterprise sector, more innovation, more efficient public procurement - that is, what our citizens value us.
In my opinion, it is not our job to predict possible developments in these countries.
The second draft concerns concessions.
Mr President, during the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, a smoking ban was introduced in Ireland in the workplace so that we met a number of fierce constituents in restaurants and public buildings.
In fact, increasing the EU budgets at a time of profound regret is an expression of Member States' confidence in their actions in a joint endeavour and an endorsement of the measures taken at supranational level.
I know we have a good message, so let us go and distribute it.
The report contains guidelines on how air agreements should be analysed, both in terms of content and in terms of the measures to be taken.
The language law creates imbalance.
Perhaps, once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force on 1 December, British domestic political debates can also be deleted from this Chamber.
That is the real situation and the European Parliament's wish to dream of a difference.
In addition, we share the view that the parliaments of all Member States must participate fully in the process, in accordance with their fiscal and control rights, in order to improve transparency, accountability and obligations in relation to decisions taken, including at European level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, five and two questions have been asked on economic governance and the Europe 2020 strategy.
I therefore believe that we must actively involve both national authorities, the European Commission and MEPs in the presentation of SOLVIT.
This is a system based on real policies and real guidelines, and now, Mr Michel, the protagonists and liberal rhetoric that have led to the current situation, in which the agro-industrial model has been promoted in line with the defence of the interests of the major agri-food industry in the world, as a result of which there has been a qualitative level of investment in agriculture for too few years, with two% of the average agricultural production being promoted.
Economically: the amount paid to producers is lower than their production costs, and the CAP must allow it to be solved.
Once again, I call on the Commission to ensure that, in its contacts with the government, it constantly emphasises the implementation of this promise until it is enshrined in the Congolese Legislative Council.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand the great interest in the measures taken by this Parliament in the Union and beyond the Union to combat the problems some Member States have encountered with regard to their own budget.
We support the peoples' desire for a better life, more power building and better tomorrow.
You even have the support of Irish Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that we should do, and we must actually follow, in order to make the world more free, fairer and more social in the future.
My office drew up an informal document on sanctions against Syria; we are in the lead.
On the agenda that we can finally overcome poverty, all Communism will disappear forever.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the revision of the competition rules relating to horizontal cooperation - B7-0565/2010).
You fought for this together, both dozens and orange.
In my opinion, as well as strengthening the food safety of the EU's inhabitants, this procedure will provide greater transparency for Member States and third countries exporting meat products to the EU.
In this context, it seems crazy to pursue the Mercosur agreement, especially when Sweden's food and biotechnology constitution has highlighted that Brazil's beef emissions can be 35 times higher than those of Irish beef.
Therefore, with the approval of the Council, the conclusion of Article 1 (4) (b) of the original text, as amended in Article 1) of the regulation, should be added to the following text:'The same reference corridor applies each year in order to correct the rates regulated in Articles 4a and 4b (3) of Article 6a (3), when these charges have been awarded in a currency other than the euro'.
Today, the Irish Government has called for and obtained European solidarity.
Let us look at Ireland, which was particularly severely affected by the financial crisis: its membership of the monetary union defended it from an even wider crisis.
He fears the Germans' demands early on and having heard German politicians discuss this issue, I think his fear is fully justified.
an increase in subsidies from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, as well as more effective financial assistance for technical measures linked to the development and implementation of the project;
If we do not implement measures to make countries understand the serious consequences of implementing economically irrational policies, we will not get anywhere.
We must step up and promote further action to limit climate change.
(Applause from the left)
As always in the case of difficult issues, I have received considerable support from my shadow rapporteurs in the group, from Bernatte Vergnaud, Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) In Russia, freedom of the press and the media is indeed an important problem.
Similarly, it is up to each Member State to decide whether to sign or ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are two important documents adopted by the Council of Europe.
That is why a structured dialogue is the one that gives us the opportunity to exchange views on alarming issues.
Thirdly, everything is connected with sustainability, so that the people who are already working are able to receive all the protection and support to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and do not have to re-study them in the next year or in the next two years, and that knowledge can be refressed in order to become the next job, which is to secure existing jobs.
Madam President, our questions are about to highlight the benefits that our citizens can expect from such a package of measures and which we can offer against such a package of measures.
I voted in favour of this report because it contains proposals which will significantly improve the European Commission's text, particularly with regard to the protection of personal data.
In addition, we reviewed the funds used for 2009, which made it possible to allocate a total of EUR 1.9 billion to the energy sector, and an additional EUR 420 million to broadband in category II.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for your clear message.
We can see something of this here, as we have seen in our efforts to follow a comprehensive approach which has not really come up as we envisaged it, but which is still on the right track.
Once again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, which was sometimes a little harsh, and the Council, where we tried to find sensible solutions in the evening meetings and in many trialogues, because it was just an hour ago they also accepted a reasonable compromise.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission set up, after the Transport Ministers' meeting of 4 May 2010, with Eurocontrol, a European aviation crisis coordination force.
At the same time, it is important to remember that rarely, in this case, illegal logging itself creates the conditions for the trade in illegal timber.
I come from a country called Portugal and the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important; it has developed in areas that are socially fragile and, in fact, where it is vital to maintain the quota system longer than 2015.
People are not a product of special cultures, but special cultures are the product of distinctive people.
In certain cases, they are, in fact, so good that they should be taken into account.
(SV) Mr President, Iceland is a small country in terms of the number of inhabitants - some 300 000 of them - but it is a large nation.
Mr President, Members of the European Parliament have an important role to play in controlling health claims.
That is why we are saying'flag' to Nabucco, but our decision to support our governments' efforts to ensure that diversification of supply is a guarantee for the well-being of our peoples.
Political parties may be banned, the legal system has been corrupt, human rights are violated, and freedom of expression and association are not in the form of countries such as Britain or the majority of Europe.
It is also quite evident that we need the broadest possible energy mix, combining the various sources of energy, because this stabilises the situation from an energy perspective, and thus the diversity of each country, as well as of Europe, can fully fulfil its potential.
However, I do wonder if Parliament is founded on condemning certain unpleasant practices on international law, although its legal basis is far from clear.
By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I clearly express my full support for the Tunisian people and the historic democratic revolution to which they have started.
In addition, Member States are called on to take appropriate measures and implement effective policy guidelines, such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty, and for regular reports of their actions to be carried out in order to address this problem.
If you push through the law and the rates in the Hungarian Parliament that, from now on, this can be modified by just two thirds majority, you will be aware that it will not be easy to amend this law after the next elections.
Comprehensive tariff preferences (debate)
Today, we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
With regard to the new mutual trust, we have another major problem.
This year, we allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS, but the real costs can be assessed after the first year of action, when the European Parliament will be presented with a report on all the costs of work relating to the EEAS.
My question relates to Pakistan, whose chronic instability is, as we all know, one factor in the entire region and also in the crisis in Afghanistan.
Of course, we cannot forget the natural biological differences between men and women.
We should not forget these factors, including the idea contained in the proposal of earmarking the revenues made from the infrastructure tax.
(HU) Mr President, what we support in this directive is a clearer definition of patients' rights, the end of endless waiting lists and the solution to the problem of not being available to medical staff in their own country.
Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, if you will allow me, I will make a few comments on the specific issues and issues that have been raised.
Last week, in the Commission, I accused the Belgian Presidency that they were strange.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the continued violations of human rights in Iran, particularly with regard to freedom of association, freedom of expression and information, and because I support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people.
It is particularly important to finance quickly.
One thing is to set up such a mechanism, but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens so that they can make full use of it.
In addition to improving the competitiveness of the Canadian and European markets, the agreement also increases the safety of the markets, as regulators and enforcement authorities will strengthen cooperation in all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement, in order to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and freight transport.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
Moreover, personal tourism participation promotes the image of Europe in the eyes of the world, as well as European citizenship.
Mr President, Vice-President Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal under discussion today aims to amend the regulations adopted in 2004, which improved and harmonised security standards for the protection of passports and travel documents of EU citizens against fraud, while introducing biometric identification features.
Secondly, a temporary institutional framework must be created for the mechanism for implementing decisions.
As a positive thing, I would note that some of the agreements that have been concluded recently are very good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why the European Parliament should once again remind the Commission of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also hope that Belgrade will realise that its current approach - its constructive cooperation with the European Union - is much more effective than its constant aspiration to rewrite history.
It is strange that the European Commission has so far found no arguments or time to influence the Latvian Government to put an end to this discrimination on the basis of language.
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to link, whatever form they grant to the Pakistani Government, the immediate elimination of the destructive discrimination against religious minorities in Pakistan.
This would also produce results in stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
This is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for it.
Clearly, more than ever, financial institutions are needed to stop and reassess their approach.
Our common goal is to minimise co-fishing and discards, and this has been achieved in the Commission.
The main objective of trade aid is to promote the internal and international competitiveness of 48 countries.
Even if you agree with the expediency of internalising external costs as a justified starting point, it is, in fact, unreasonable to punish only heavy goods vehicles with a view to reducing traffic congestion, and not ordinary vehicles, as well as the old'polluter pays' principle in a clearly discriminatory manner.
I have been encouraged by the understanding and support expressed during this debate in plenary.
Moreover, if we look at the destination position, some problems appear.
The main objective of the governments of the European Union and its Member States, be they on the right or left, is to protect the continued profits of the monopolies, which shift the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working class throughout the European Union.
Therefore, measures should be taken to promote good practices and raise awareness among local decision makers of the benefits offered by ICT.
Mr President, we did not hear the English interpretation of the previous speech.
However, with this recast, with the codification, there is one very important aspect relating to the whole of the trans-European transport network over the next 10 years.
(LT) Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is very important for the inhabitants of Ukraine, but let us not forget that it is also important for the residents of the European Union, as Ukraine is our important partner, especially in implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe.
The Commission must therefore act forcefully.
We cannot intervene in a matter in which only the US Government is competent.
People who manage our wooded lands are little or not paid at all for their hidden functions, which many people take for granted.
Unfortunately, it must also be said that the list of unresolved problems will become longer than shorter.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - (NL) With regard to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra's valuable report on the EU strategy for developing relations with Latin America, I should like to appeal to the Council and the Commission, both represented by Baroness Ashton, to take urgent action on three issues.
There are large dealers who have strongly developed in the market of some Member States, and there are also many small dealers who have been more satisfied with what we are proposing at the moment than with what has been proposed since 2002, because they have seen that certain aspects of the legislator, which were not intending to hold up with them in 2002, have been rather difficult for them to compete with them.
It needs to draw up a'EU regional policy partnership for peace, security and development on the Horn of Africa', initiated by the Committee on Development when adopted its report in April 2007.
Over the years, and especially following the historic expansion of 2004, the context and aspirations of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) have changed considerably.
in writing. - (LT) Spain is taking over the Presidency of the European Union at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force directly.
It is therefore important to ensure that the first radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already stated in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda, and that the Single Market Act includes a priority measure.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) I should like to unequivocally support Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission's draft was modified in line with the report voted on today, following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is therefore important to reach an agreement at first reading.
These people need help most and they should not be excluded from the scope of the measures because of their location.
All medical care, despite its specialist nature, falls within the scope of the treaty.
However, I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that the recent study by the European career association has once again shown that, due to the participation of a few women in these types of tests, the methodology is subject to significant restrictions.
The basic principle is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives but, at the same time, that should not prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives.
I call for more attention to be paid to the reintroduction of organic waste, in particular, in this largely agricultural area, in order to control data and to the introduction of a system for exchanging good practice.
It is completely incomprehensible that the law on the presumption of the Orthodox Chambers, bishops and patriarticles of law must be the citizens of Turkey.
The most important point in this position that Parliament has adopted is the attention it draws to the dispersion of measures which may therefore lack cohesion, not only as a legislator, but especially as regards their implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
At least the digital single market has made a breakthrough among the EU's priorities.
This would be an important step forward towards the transparency, openness and clarity of the European process.
(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because it makes every sense to discuss this.
Is this the model of economic development that the European Union wants to offer Europeans?
I will not allow the speakers as a rule to exceed the allocated time, but I think we all agree that the statement by Mrs Tzavela was particularly important to us.
We want to see a proper strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investments, the implementation of which will improve the quality of life of all European citizens living in the Danube region.
This is indeed a great achievement, given that without taking into account the legal basis, this directive recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and opens up new opportunities for them to obtain better treatment.
In any year, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us assurances that the budgetary resources of the European Union have been used legally and without infringements, and when I was the chief negotiator of the Commission in 2002, I was very concerned about the lack of control of taxpayers' money.
This is both a huge challenge and a great honour for me.
To be honest, we have to acknowledge our historic responsibility for climate change and the fact that our emissions per capita are still much higher than, for example, China and India.
I am sure that the next dialogue will be constructive.
It is therefore regrettable, as in the case of Europol, that accelerating has become more important than the desire to defend fundamental freedoms.
I agree with the Commission's proposal aimed at introducing a complementary, simplified method of using funds from the European Social Fund in order to ensure that it can respond more quickly and effectively to the economic and social challenges Europe is facing.
To be honest, I should have voted against the composition of the Commission presented to us, but alongside the weak candidates there were also a number of very good candidates, such as the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
President of the Commission. - You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but, in addition to the UK, there are actually 26 other Member States in the European Union, so you will understand that, although we are very mindful of the concerns you have expressed, I must also listen to other justified concerns.
In my opinion, we need to be careful on this issue to maintain neutrality in the EU's response to humanitarian situations, even though this is sometimes complex in crisis areas.
It also includes new aspects of Parliament's previous words, such as the call for the Commission Vice-President of the Union and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to assess the results of investigations by the parties concerned and to inform the European Parliament of its assessments, recalling that the responsibilities and reliability of the European Union and its Member States oblige them to be fully monitored and expressed their concern for the actions taken in drafting and investigating the investigations carried out on the basis of the external organisations involved in the Goldstone report.
I also hope that the decision will help us protect the species of fish under threat of extinction.
I hope that you will not treat my questions as a provocation, but as a reflective tool for encouraging aid.
I wish and hope I can come back to Parliament with good explanations, but we need to prove what we have discovered.
This result strengthens the EU's position in international trade talks, especially in the ongoing WTO Doha Round negotiations.
If Europe speaks with one voice, the United States will also commit itself to the same goal.
That is why I personally support European tobacco growers' prices at least as long as people in Europe smoke.
If we look at the initiatives that have been taken so far by the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries are taking the problem more seriously than others.
I would therefore like to see a European Social Fund that is separate from European structural policy.
The number of patients infected is growing faster than the amount of treatment and in 2009, two thirds of people in need of treatment were deprived of this, meaning that tens of million people had not had the necessary effective treatment available.
In fact, if human dignity is seen as valuable, the minorities are not treated in any way negatively.
I welcome the Commission's proposals to simplify this fund.
All the EU institutions should ensure in future that our budgets are used to help people and businesses and to help them with recovery plans in economically difficult times.
The quickest, much more effective and practical way of improving them than all top-down measures are supporting citizens' initiatives and cultural organisations and regional institutions.
To all those who are still struggling to combat this agreement, mistaken in the belief that this agreement will give the European Union influence, I would say the following: those who are fighting this agreement will actually strengthen our partners, in other words, our opponents.
The emitting of global capitalism has stifled us all in the European Union.
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting in which the Commission will continue to develop other modes of transport.
You will remember that this was a fierce fight, because it came from the European Court of Justice and the European Commission was clear - and I must pay tribute to the Commission - more explicit, clearer than the Council and we fully supported it.
Mr Madlener was the first to speak.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.
(DE) Mr President, the sad chosen by the governments of the EU's fundamental Member States, the European Commission and the European Central Bank are clearly identified.
I would remind the House that, on the basis of the recent observation, there are still more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union, which has probably increased to 25 million now, meaning that by attracting even more asylum seekers, we are actually concluding a collective suicide.
The Commission - not the finance ministers - must impose sanctions.
The economic recovery in Sri Lanka depends on foreign direct investment and EU support.
We are fully in favour of the objective of the vaccine initiative, but we could not support the reference to another vote by the European Parliament, which, among other things, supports abortion and contradicts the explanations of vote that we have given in the European Parliament.
This document is a compromise which has been reached as a result of long negotiations, which will strengthen the implementation of passenger rights without placing additional burdens on carriers.
Indeed, in the EMU, it is high time to breathe life into the so-called'E; a real and effective economic union must be established as the last step of European economic policy integration.
I am particularly interested in the issue of children's rights within the framework of external relations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, for 10 years now, the European Union has been trying to equip itself with legislation in the field of economic migration.
The Stihler report is a valuable tool to remove national administrative and technical barriers preventing the marketing of construction products within the European Union and to develop a common market in this sector.
I believe that if we really want to stick to the foreign policy objectives set out in the treaties, we will still have a long way to go before we can send immigrants who are staying illegally in the European Union back to Libya.
That is why I endorsed the resolution on the European Innovation Partnerships within the Innovation Union, and I think that we should all be involved in innovation because, as I said, this is very important for the future.
We have a newly elected government in the United Kingdom that has made commitments in this respect.
The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 establishing specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand and produce a positive result, both for the environment and for employment.
There are countries that do not make use of the European Social Fund (ESF) funds allocated to them, but which are responsible for around 30-40% of them.
Therefore, the question arises as to why, if the Commission, as it says, has the information that it publishes and is obliged to disclose, then why no one, for example, knew about the abovementioned.
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I fully support the proposal for an effective information campaign to improve the visibility of points of single contact.
It seems rather odd that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to fight the economic crisis and wants to make the achievement of economic policy objectives mandatory.
Today, I voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation in the area of unitary patent protection because I believe that the deadlock in the Council as a result of language arrangements is unjustified.
I repeat: the agreement clearly states that the Member States must not be forced to transpose debts.
I would like to remind you of the common agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the appointment of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion in 2010.
Let me assure you that Parliament will continue to raise these issues, including at the highest level, recalling the international commitments of the People's Republic of China in terms of human rights.
I hope - and I am sure your votes will be the basis for this agreement.
Firstly, I regret the fact that the Commissioner's colleague, Mr McCreevy, is not here - apparently the season for houses has already begun.
You may not know that, but detailed animal testing, for example, must be done to confirm such claims.
Commissioner, I have doubts about the fact that the 21 groups and industry in the CARS have a significant impact on the process being launched here.
We disagree.
The European Union's assistance in supporting Moldova's development and good governance will amount to more than EUR 50 million between 2007 and 2010.
Of course, we cannot understand how an illegal worker can start to work, and the person who employs his job by concealing his or her place of residence and covering the cost of survival can ultimately be punished.
I believe that the measuring system based on the approval of the various research parameters is accompanied by political decisions that are better suited to the needs of society and the economy in general.
At the same time, I would like to point out that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on the lifting of restrictions on freedoms and the end of the repression of peaceful demonstration parties and human rights activists.
Finally, Baroness Ashton, you are about to go to the Middle East.
Worse still, only one month after the creation of the International Criminal Court in July 2002, the United States Congress adopted an American Law on the Protection of Careans.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make clear in this report that the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been added to the resolutions adopted by this House on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission's proposal to allow the marketing of poultry meat used as human beings in the European Union, even after its processing.
Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and by expressing my greatest concern for the four other Cuban prisoners and one of the opposition extremists who have launched a hunger strike in protest.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 on the area of freedom, security and justice (Stockholm Programme).
Our motto should be not to waste any cents.
The European Union, and the Mediterranean countries in particular, have always been a leader in providing humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people, as solidarity is a basic element for people living in such trouble.
Often, the workers themselves have risen in isolation, and it is very difficult to access trade unions in such a situation.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Commissioners and the Commission for their statements.
However, Mrs Guillaume's report, as it stands - although some of the amendments have helped to improve it - provides people with a real impetus to abuse this procedure, thus congesting the relevant services and depriving those who really need a swift review of the matter.
It is our time and our duty to do everything we can, and I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work, which will benefit us all.
We have indeed gone through a huge programme containing large and important reports.
'social dumping'means a major threat to workers, as it violates their rights to a very significant extent.
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, in connection with what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of every proposal, I should like to ask whether a preliminary study can be carried out on this matter, including cooperation between Europe and the Mediterranean and the specific nature of the region, so that there are criteria that each country must take into account and draw up from the outset.
We must also pay attention to the issue of Roma women, who suffer particular poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence, as well as the problem of young Roma people, as the lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to access employment during the current economic crisis.
in writing. - (PT) I am pleased to vote in favour of the amendment to the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which aims to extend housing interventions at the expense of the EGF in such a way as to assist marginalised communities in all Member States.
Furthermore, it reminds all politicians in their spheres of competence that, in order to achieve effective freedom of the press, public authorities really have a clear task: they must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and support its development.
Mr President, I believe that the European Union has become too large, that there are too many cultures, and I simply do not trust this system to the least extent and the situation is getting worse.
It is a little too early to announce the results of this analysis and, as the Member knows, every step in this process requires the Council's consensus.
It is important to point out that the prospect of integration with the European Union is the strongest incentive for the Balkan countries to implement the necessary reforms, but it is also one of the factors for ensuring the stability of the region.
Today, as advertising plays an increasingly important role, it is essential for us to lay down criteria which will enable consumers and patients to be fully aware of the effects of this product.
To paraphrase them, they would be a small step for European funds, but a huge leap for the European economy.
Thirdly, there are simply no security events, which are constantly claimed if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement.
The rapid spread of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years has increased the spread of online gambling and the resulting cross-border issues, which remain unresolved.
All people who decide in this area should have equal access to specialised information on the country of origin and the bodies to resolve complaints, and information should also be provided to those seeking asylum.
So, after all these years, I understand how important a step you took in setting up the multi-faceted Parliament formed by means of the only general elections in the world.
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion a year on protection, and this EUR 200 billion must be spent better than in the past.
We have achieved something together.
In addition, during this parliamentary term, we will be working on services of general interest.
I could therefore propose that, for example, we invite the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr Almunia, to do this for himself, because he was quite critical of some countries during his term of office, and then the Greek question arose.
There is a great need for reforms in Turkey on this issue.
In the past, other EU countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, have benefited from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, so we should give this assistance to Lithuania.
Use fuel and radioactive waste (debate)
I will limit myself to just the latest incidents, such as the dismantling of the Catholic Materia in the town of Vinh Long, in order to build a public park for this index, or the use of the marty-makers and Bulgarians, in order to remove the death toll of Neitsi Made in Hanoi.
Moreover, the Social Fund plays an important role in the areas of education, lifelong vocational training, job opportunities and the integration of workers into the labour market.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes
I am therefore voting in favour of rejecting the Commission's proposal.
Now it has taken place, and I supported this motion with my vote.
There is only one answer: growth.
