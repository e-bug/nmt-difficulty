I would like to mention a few of the challenges that the new state will have to face : firstly , the parties include the former President of South Africa and the President of the African Union , Thabo Mbeki. I would like to emphasise his role as mediator , as our Special Representative for Sudan , Rosalind Marsden .
I would like to thank the workers of the social economy who have spoken and allowed Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission , so that a single European statute for mutual societies , associations and foundations is finally recognised .

Mr President , it is clear that Kashgar is the symbol for excellence of Uyghur cultural identity in the Chinese province of Xinjiang .
Mr President , from the agricultural point of view , this debate has been very encouraging in all areas of the House , and I particularly welcome the emphasis placed on the need to stimulate young people to remain in agriculture , which is absolutely essential , and it has also been stressed that there must be no renationalisation of the CAP .
In the same way , we propose that we pursue the conduct of a cost-benefit analysis of variable expenditure .
Membership of committees and delegations : see Minutes
As a number of Members have already pointed out , however , we must exercise the utmost caution as regards methods and instruments to be used in order to facilitate this vulnerable economic sector in an immediate and rapid manner .

Not at all .
Today , after the events in Georgia and following the recognition by Russia of the enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Russia &apos;s readiness to build a joint security zone with the European Union and the parties &apos; positions on issues such as Kosovo and the common neighbourhood are more than ever .
We have developed a common benchmark in the European Union for the rights of minorities , and that is an indispensable benchmark .
However , there is expected that there will be surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances and divergence of competitiveness for Member States linked to the euro , due to the highest level of penetration between Member States of the euro area ; less market discipline ; the lack of risks linked to the exchange rate and more demanding adjustment at a high cost for the euro area as a whole .
It is important for my country , and especially for those affected , that this decision be adopted by the European Parliament .
It is not enough to add the word &apos; solidarity &apos; to an amendment to make European energy policy acceptable if the same amendment , among other things , prevents the EU from directly intervening in the market .
The aim is to get the usual practice of using national rules to disappear in the railway world in order to hinder the type-approval of rolling materials that are already type-approval by other states .
From now on , however , we can conclude that racism and xenophobia are still occurring in the European Union that affect the existence of ethnic minorities .

I will not be surprised to hear you say that I strongly support the first solution .
We need to create an appropriate framework for our contractual relations and the agreement on trade and cooperation that is currently in force does not allow it .

I would like to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and with all those who have been affected and my support for local councillors , but at the same time , I would like to use this debate to appeal to the European Community , as it must be said that such a situation requires a response and , above all , solidarity at European level .
My comments on the reports and their conclusions will be relatively short .

The only thing that can prevent the migration flow to Europe of immigrants who are most in need of a low level of education , the search for their place in the world , is a coherent , well-conceived policy on immigration , as other speakers have also said , such as that which Canada and New Zealand has been implementing .

We all want you to be successful , so everyone - Parliament , the Commission , the Council and the European Central Bank - must reflect together to find the best way to go about .

Last month , the scandal of the University of East Anglia broke out and then the Himalaya glaciers collapsed and now we are wondering about the effects of climate change on the flora and fauna in Amazony .

- ( LT ) Madam President , the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is a subject of particular importance , both for the safety of people and the environment and for society .

As a result of a farce trial and a close prison from the family , which makes it difficult to carry out difficult visits , Taoufik Ben Brik is in a state of health that is feeding for his life .
However , this positive trend has not gone hand in hand with the protection and respect of the rights of travellers : many of them are the drawbacks of passengers such as cancellations , excessive booking , loss of and delays .

Unfortunately , however , the real objective has been to achieve the success and appearance of our businesses , which are small and medium-sized enterprises .
The issue of geographical balance , which has often been pointed out , could have been resolved in a better way .
On the other hand , we cannot ignore tendencies in the area of media freedom , which are a cause for concern .
I really do not understand how we can use the death of so many people to address this kind of criticism against the European institutions .

I expect the same level of interest from the US authorities , including with regard to the equal treatment of Member States as regards the visa waiver programme .
If Mrs Roure wants to go to Lampedusa tomorrow morning , he does not even find a child , and if she says that it is Mr Maroni who has denounced the trafficking of organs : children were shooting , when the left wing of our country was in government , from Lampedusa .
I do not deny that nuclear energy can be included in a well-balanced European energy package and that its use can reduce our external dependence in this area , but I believe that the European Union cannot refrain from participating in efforts to close the now obsolete Bulgarian nuclear plant and , at the same time , ensure that projects in the economic recovery plan receive adequate funding .
The decisions of the summit and also the statements by the President of the United States confirm that NATO does not oppose the common security and defence policy , but rather seeks to find a way of cooperating that is good for both organisations .

Mr Leinen &apos;s report explains the impact of the Treaty on Parliament &apos;s activities and analyses in detail the implications for Parliament of the new policy areas , new powers and procedures .
I do not want to accuse anyone , but experience shows that next time we need to do better .

That is why I hope that we will be able to improve the safety of children by increasing the quantity of Internet material that can encourage them , educate them and develop them , and not the kind of things that we currently find so often to be able to harm the growth of young people &apos;s personality as a whole .
That would be regrettable .

author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we certainly , as an international community , take a great deal of credibility on what is happening in Afghanistan .
However , our arguments have to be content , otherwise the citizens will think that the European Union will only worry for itself and that they will not realise that the interests of the people are of concern to us .
That is why we are seeing the still timid demands of Members who encourage Member States to accept innocent prisoners , who cannot go back to their countries for fear of torture .

Tourism has changed radically over the last decade , including through technological progress .
If and when Turkey does not make any unambiguous efforts to establish good relations with its neighbours , it resolves issues that are still unresolved peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter and other European texts , so that we can have hopes .

It is therefore the man who is sitting next to the South African lady : &apos; Ladies and gentlemen , if she wants to do her , then , first and foremost , there is a place reserved for her &apos; .

You represent a country whose citizens have resembled to the invasion of troops of the Warsaw Pact .
Thanks to the directive , fund managers must be registered and authorised to comply with strict rules of conduct within the European Union .

The populations in question simply dream of a better life , and a better life does not necessarily mean democracy .

Europe &apos;s commitment to its citizens was therefore reaffirmed by the will of this Parliament to find in the 2011 budget , even with very small margins , space to give substance to this fund .
That is why the parliamentary question was supported by such a large majority in committee , and that is something that I very much appreciate .

The new Green New Deal , a new logic of economic organisation based on innovation in terms of environmental technology and supported by international capital markets , will be a cornerstone of an increasingly large number of economic recovery programmes and incentives , including among EU Member States .
The bilateral agreements signed by some Member States on the implementation of projects such as Nord Stream result in mistrust not only of environmental issues , but also of the principles of solidarity , so transparency is needed in this area .
This is a good thing , and it is an important result .
We all understand the need for a drastic change of course to the current policy , and this attitude is clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy .
However , what really matters now now is that the Commission and the Member States are able to act well in Copenhagen .
My second point concerns the prospect of multilateralism being put forward , an idea that has so often been professed in this House .
In Parliament , many of my fellow Members from all political groups have already demonstrated their commitment , but it is our duty to give greater political strength to this issue .

I must therefore disagree with Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s opinion that the whole package has only one morder , the reversed qualified majority voting .

I agree with the rapporteur when she says that the transposition , implementation and proper application of the directives on unfair commercial practices and misleading and comparative advertising are of fundamental importance to the achievement of the objectives set out in the directives themselves , in particular , in the light of the different methods and systems of application and enforcement used by the Member States , the complexity of certain legal concepts contained in the directives , the quantities and exhaustive of the national rules governing the scope of advertising and extensive application of large practices and extensive practices .
The European Union should take action to ensure gender equality and reduce gender segregation in the labour market .

( PL ) Mr President , in the context of today &apos;s debate , I would like to draw attention to the controversial proposal to amend Rule 47 of the Commission &apos;s Rules of Procedure of 2006 .
I would also like to mention the Global Employment Pact of the World Trade Organisation , which presents a suitable set of strategic options for emerging from the crisis .
Given the serious consequences of bluetongue for livestock farming , all measures that facilitate good practice should be taken to protect farmers from the loss of animals , which often causes them irreparable damage .

In my country , Estonia , this fund has not been used and , when I asked why it was said that the conditions were too stringent and that the threshold set up to 1 000 redundancies has made it impossible to access them so far .
I believe that together , we will be able to lay down the basic principles that should guide and facilitate future opportunities for cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .

I would therefore like to express my surprise and ask that next time , every Member knows exactly how to act in order to be able to speak .
One of the reasons why I voted in favour of strengthening the OSCE is the human rights aspect , which involves respect for fundamental freedoms and the rights of minorities , which are essential elements of the integrated concept of organisation .

I am pleased that the Commission supported the extension of the transitional period so that , when the new legislation is introduced , it will be applied uniformly in all EU countries .
The European Union is not democratic and therefore cannot be adequately guarded by the rights of people .
I would also like to emphasise a fundamental feature of this fund , namely that of helping people more than companies and , in this respect , we cannot therefore regard it as a rehabilitation equipment for companies with no realistic hope of survival in economic terms , but rather as a method of rehabilitation .

The Commission seems to be taking decisive action in the area of employment and social policy only in times of crisis and to do so by imposing cuts in social expenditure and salaries .

The European Union &apos;s presence in Kosovo is becoming increasingly tangible and is becoming the subject of the UN .
By details , the motion for a resolution contains some aspects with which we cannot agree , namely the promotion of global carbon trading , since the resolution has already shown that it does not offer advantages with the creation of more public-private partnerships , placing the emphasis on a &apos; substantial increase in the share of public investment &apos; , so that public money should be used to serve private and useful interests .
However , the practical aspects of an agreement with a state of Congo raise all sorts of concerns .
As far as I am concerned , I believe that there is a single race among human beings , that of men .
President Mubarak , in his current situation - and with respect to his long struggle - is not in a position to lead the political transition ; it is the crowds from him that kind of thing , and to let the Czech Republic , Mr Mubarak , today , the Elan Baradi via the shores of capital .
The social situation has developed very positively , with a significant increase in average income per capita , and now the vast majority of Tunisian people have the criteria to be defined as classes .

All the elements mentioned form at least a whole which allows , in my opinion , to provide a consistent response .

The role of legislators is called into question here in particular .
Rather than say a year after the earthquake , we must say a year of earthquake , an earthquake in earthquakes , and then the earthquake in aid , the health earthquake with cholera , the political earthquake with untransparent elections , and probably at the most appropriate time and an earthquake in certain , even historic , even now , with the return from Turkish misleading misleading , billionist of the former dictator .
It is true that , if the same guidelines , policies and pressure continue to be applied to Portugal and other countries with more fragile economies , differences will get worse and the situation will deteriorate due to the lack of solidarity on the part of the European Union .

This means , above all , for SMEs , financial problems , a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness .

The administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political repression , all these methods are incompatible with the obligations of the People &apos;s Republic of China as a Member State of the United Nations .

There is no point whatsoever in that .

Finally , I would like to comment on the relationship between international trade and climate change .
This report proposes various measures , some of which may be useful to small businesses , but whose global effect is to promote EU control , the exploitation of the population , feminist programmes and the infiltration of EU officials in companies to &apos; work experience &apos; .
This derogation is proposed to tackle a crisis that is before us all and which we have often argued against many times .
Indeed , it is clear that there is a very serious link between public finances and the financial and economic crisis .
Over the course of these 15 years , the 189 countries which have signed the UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality have been able to make progress in all 12 areas of interest identified in the document .

The representatives came to Brussels to tell this Parliament that , if we confirm the alternative investment law as well as the bozzlers , we could cut the funds of their organisation by two thirds .
The key words will certainly be &apos; added value &apos; , &apos; coherence &apos; , &apos; flexibility &apos; and &apos; simplicity &apos; .
There are , of course , other means to tackle the crisis beyond this , but I am sure that Commissioner Almunia is prepared to discuss it with you on a later occasion .
I support this report because forests , which cover more than 42 % of the EU &apos;s surface , provide a livelihood for many workers and companies in the forestry sector .
Unfortunately , he is well aware that it is the Member State governments that decide on institutions &apos; offices and , unfortunately , under the chairmanship of the former leader of the party , John Major , who , at his summit in Edinburgh 2 , imposed on the European Parliament the legal obligation to hold 12 returns a year to Strasbourg .
The Committee believes that petroleum should not be included as part of a process of evaluation under way at European level because of the different way in which certain anorizizstant agents are done .
We have always advocated the need to start a reconciliation dialogue and to continue the existing dialogue .
It makes sense to reach agreement first on the large lines of the European 2020 strategy and to wait for the budget review to be presented by the new Commission , so that the College has full ownership of the proposal so that it can work closely with you on the future financial perspective .
Without a European policy to support the shipping sector , it is difficult for production to return to previous levels to the crisis .
There is no point in continuing to push ahead with the evolution of the Lisbon Strategy in the worsening economic and social crisis which , among other things , has been caused by the implementation of this strategy .
If we do not contravene the status quo , rail freight will no longer be exempted in the space of 20 years .

Volcanic ash can cause a poor decline in the engines of aircraft and reduce visibility by curbing the windows of aircraft , so the European Air Navigation Security Organisation , Eurocontrol , has adopted a responsible approach , taking passenger safety as a priority .
This is therefore a legislative package that reconciles health and the environment with competitiveness and innovation , rather than contracting them , as is all too often the case .

The outcome of this analysis should be reflected in the report on verification of decent work , the publication of which is awaited for 2011 .
I recognise that this is not perfect and that there are still concerns .
In addition to the poverty that still exists , which unfortunately still exists , we are today concerned about global environmental problems such as climate change , and we are now basically discussing a kind of international insurance premium to compensate the victims of economic and social suffering caused by the financial disaster .
Finally , I would like to wish Commissioner Kovács every success in his future work .
Instead , we do not support the passages of increased agricultural aid through POSEI for the EU &apos;s producers affected by the agreement .
I believe that , with this in mind , European diplomacy will be able to play a more active and decisive role in defending the fundamental interests of the European Union , including in the area of energy security .
I would like to reiterate once again that the citizens of the European Union watch us carefully to see how we react to the much-needed Treaty of Lisbon .
We in the June List believe that a multiannual programme or a European agency for linguistic diversity and linguistic learning at EU level does not make any difference for nearly 500 million European citizens , if we do not face the burden of taxpayers even further .
However , this completely criminal objective has , in a sense , become one of the fronts of the interinstitutional war which , let us say it openly , has been opposed to the European Parliament for years to the Council .
Let us acknowledge this : one of the reasons why the Commission is presenting such a large number of mixed , inadequate proposals that the UK and other countries must adapt is precisely the lack of transparency .
I challenge anyone to resolve this rebus !
However , for people affected - families and serious injuries - it will be of little consolation if we continue to say that rail is the safest mode of transport and that the number of accidents is very low in relation to road transport .
We would also like to see a solution at the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit to the problem of visa requirements , which the Canadian Government partly reintroduced towards European citizens from the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania .

( Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
Ladies and gentlemen , under the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , I declare the first sitting of the European Parliament open following the elections .
I also voted in favour of this report because economic stability can also lead to political stability in this region that has been so wrong for years .
Parliament has also improved the text by underlining the importance of training for those who practise the forensic profession aimed at cooperation and bringing the respective legal structures closer together through mutual recognition and trust , in order to complement the response instruments and to make the European Union a genuine area of freedom , justice and security .
Why is it so difficult to say that it should be for the people of the Middle East ?
Mr President , this debate is taking place at a particularly significant time for tourism , the aviation industry and consumer protection industry .
I therefore support the proposals made by the rapporteur which aim to strike a fair balance between private life and the security of the individual on the Internet , while respecting his fundamental rights and freedoms .
Of course , we are in democracy : we are discussing this issue and exchanging views is interesting .
I am pleased that the European Parliament will finally be able to enter the Sea and discuss the different future guidelines that should be adopted in this respect .
The EU must not wait until 2014 to make structural and regional funding more flexible ; it must do so now , so that the Roma , too , can benefit from this .
Any restrictions must also be justified by legitimate interests : national security , public safety , preventing unrest or crime , protection of health or of moral and so on .
Mr President , I represent the High Commissioner and I represent the Commission .
We must act quickly , not only with regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan , which we will be talking about in a short time , but also with regard to Iraq .
The ALDE Group regrets that , on the eve of the summit , Russia imposed a disproportionate ban on imports of vegetables from the EU .
It also shows that the burden of over-regulation , which often increases the image of the European Union , is often not the fault of the institutions of the European Union , but of the Member State itself .
This draft jeopardises the use of minority languages in every aspect of life , affecting , for example , half a million Hungarians living in Slovakia .
The dairy sector is currently going through an unprecedented crisis : production prices have fallen dramatically , consumer prices have risen and many farms in the EU are struggling for survival .
We welcome the fact that the European Commission &apos;s proposal , led by President Durão Barroso , aimed at excluding self-employed road transport workers from the directive on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities , was rejected as a result of the proposal that we made to do so .
In this context , leading figures , political parties , citizens who have fled to the streets and trade unions reiterate that Eurobonds can play a key role in overcoming the debt crisis and in safeguarding the stability of the euro .
We should not fail to do so .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Explanations of vote
Secondly , we want to mention the issue of non-tariff barriers .
Small and medium-sized enterprises are the engine of the European economy and they are the producer of sustainable growth , as they can create many good jobs .
Other things , such as the opportunity to give proper importance to the German language as a tool of work , as provided for in the treaties , have also been ignored .
The longer we remain without an agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme , the greater the risk of terrorist attacks being made that could have been avoided .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this is a debate that is taking place in Parliament .
This also means strengthening the education sector and investing in education , research and innovation as a cornerstone of a sustainable social market economy , and a sustainable and more environmentally friendly economy .
It is regrettable that this resolution is lagging behind with the statements by some Heads of State or Government and UN officials on the explanation of tens of thousands of US military troops in the country .
The costs and bureaucracy associated with the ill-considered policy of multilingualism will only increase , as the European Union continues to expand .
This has not been done .
They may seem remote , but if there is one thing that the brave Burmese people can learn from us , from this Parliament , from Europe , it is that tyranny will never be able to break the light of freedom and that , one day , freedom , their inalienable right , will certainly be brought to Myanmar .
We must face up to this situation by supporting each other and devising a coordinated strategy , instead of acting as a &apos; save you &apos; and preventing you from breaking with each other .
After the agenda , three documents will be published on broadband : one on broadband communication , which will describe the implementation of the agenda in this area , the second is a recommendation on the entry of new generation ( NOA ) , which will penalise the platform promoting investment in high-speed Internet , while the third will be the first radio spectrum policy programme , which will be the basis of the Commission &apos;s strategy for the purpose of generating a variety of wireless strategy in order to generate a large proportion of the Commission .
The aim of this directive is clear : we need more organs for patients and greater cooperation between Member States in this area and in the fight against organ trafficking .
Too little has been done during the process of rescuing the banks to respond to this predictable development .
As far as production and employment are concerned , today there are only a few nights left in the areas of high quality , luxury and high technology .
Confidence is inevitably undermined when a government puts its banks at a stress test in the summer and only a few months later , it is realised that this was not a stress test for the banks , but for the euro .
I welcomed with great enthusiasm the adoption of this report because , in terms of the promotion of research and innovation , which are intended to be the keywords of the current and future growth of the Union , it gives a voice to the common feeling of the citizens who are most affected : the need to monitor and simplify the financial and administrative aspects of the projects , while also strengthening the process of scientific assessment and technological evaluation .
Membership of committees and delegations : see Minutes
I believe that political parties and parliamentary groups hostile to populism and demagoguery should make their voices heard more .
I would like to draw your attention to the current urgent measure and to the fact that an increase in the de minimis aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 may be a problem for Member States with increased budgetary difficulties .
( The sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m. )
I would therefore like to ask you , in your closing speech , to address some of these concrete issues so that citizens can be held accountable for the issues that we are discussing .
Three points have just been mentioned , but the context - the idea that the Europe 2020 idea will also be about economic , social and environmental issues - has been lost , or at least risk of slipping out .
That is not my words .
It follows that a large majority is today in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon , including the majority of its countrymen .
We must therefore be careful about this .
We should fight against this and support those who are punished in this way .
I am sorry , but it cannot .
I believe that restrictive sanctions and measures are an important political instrument for the European Union in the areas of foreign and security policy , and of course also in the areas of justice and the defence of fundamental human rights .
This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises , which are the cornerstone of our economy .
( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , but I would like to raise an important issue related to it .
We supported this resolution in order to send a strong signal that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs are together with the Haitian people in the long term necessary to rebuild the infrastructure , communities and individual human lives that have been broken and disrupted by the catastrophe .
It is clear that we are determined to continue to offer our support to such actions and to address this problem within the European Union , not only in the area of the prevention of violence , but also in the area of immigration , asylum and criminal justice .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Many Member States are responsible for the Guantánamo issue because , for example , they granted the right to smile for the illegal transportation of prisoners .
According to this programme , trade policy remains a very important instrument for addressing the opportunities and challenges of globalisation and promoting economic growth , job creation and prosperity for all citizens in Europe .
I would therefore like to point out that we , for our part , intend to remove any obstacles .
I would like to mention one more point that concerns me , which is the entry of products from outside the European Union .
Unfortunately , it is realised that the deliberate intention behind many measures is to conceal the irresponsibility that still characterises our institutions , including the lack of clarity in the allocation of legislative power .
I would like to add a few important political aspects : Tunisia is a multi-party society , albeit limited , with a share of the opposition , of course , but it is a multi-party society .
We have had a problem with the appointment of 18 Members of this Parliament because some Member States do not actually have a procedure in place , but we have decided that representativeness is the most important issue , that this is the principle that must guide us and that this Parliament must have a balanced representation as soon as possible .
As has already been said here , smart land use , social and economic development in harmony with the nature and increased cohesion in the European Union are also key factors in disaster prevention .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and make further progress in this respect .
The legal texts before us define the framework and cover the main guidelines , but we are still waiting for real , concrete steps .
I also believe that we should go beyond the current proposal on a greener Single Market , for example , using ecological supplies .
I refer to the importance of the amendment pointing out that the issue of observers must be addressed , bearing in mind that these observers must be chosen among the candidates for the European Parliament elections , which are among the first unelected representatives .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s resolutions : see Minutes
We can talk about 2020 , but today we have a more pressing problem : the euro area and Greece .
Information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) are an important sector , even as an important sector in the European economy : there is talk of 7 % of the workforce , that is , the 7 % of the European workforce , and they represent 6 % of GDP , so they represent a meaningless share of the economy and of the European workforce and the European context .
I foresee that a number of initiatives will be presented to the Commission to redouble its efforts and there will be more Europe , which the Commission will certainly react enthusiastically .
If we do not shoulder our responsibilities and do not take a clear line , we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier : we must be aware that in 2020 - and we have set it with the Digital Agenda - every European must be able to take care of its interests through the opportunities created ultimately by spectrum .
These organisations base their power on the satisfaction of the everyday needs of the population and strengthen their power through terror .
Statements by the President
I voted in favour of the Commission &apos;s radio spectrum policy programme ( RSPP ) because I am convinced that all EU citizens must enjoy a faster broadband connection by 2020 .
The consequences of the uncontrolled exploitation of its natural resources would be catastrophic , not only for surrounding areas and for indigenous people , but for the whole world .
( RO ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Győri on her term of office and wishing you good luck and the Hungarian Presidency well .
We also look forward to the nanomaterials for which the part of cloning exposes , we can move forward quickly .
A fruitful partnership will be important , above all , in the areas of financial services , economic governance , implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy , energy and the internal market .
If we look at emerging countries , China , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia , they are also making commitments within them that go far beyond what the scientific community is asking them .
The protocol provides for the EU to correspond to São Tomé and Príncipe a contribution of EUR 682 500 per year , of which EUR 227 500 is aimed at supporting the application of the São Tomé and Príncipe &apos;s sectoral policy , which I fully support .
We will follow its implementation in the future .
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament &apos;s efforts more seriously in this regard , although it is very disappointed and concerned that the Council representative is no longer here .
If Europe wants to play an active role , it is essential that it continues to do so .
This report is a further step towards ensuring that the European Council , the European Commission and the Member States take action on the situation of homelessness .
In the event of family expulsion , for example , it must be allowed to choose whether or not to remain or follow the family expulsion .
This scanned agreement was signed on the label and ratified in a August of the 1980s .
Negotiations with Japan aimed at strengthening trade relations cannot be used as a class weapon at the service of large financial institutions and companies , which promotes even greater exploitation of workers and peoples , the destruction of their productive force and the degradation of the environment .
Let us confirm that we will do what we are obliged to do , as promised in AII , with regard to the budget reform by the end of the year .
In the Congo in July and August alone , over 500 people , including children , women of even 75 years of mass rapes , have been the victim of mass rape .
Therefore , the initial draft of the report , which included the fulfilment of a House of European History with exorbitant Management costs , was totally contrary to my deep conviction of the need to maintain complete budgetary rigour in the management of public funds .
After all , these are investments which are not immediately profitable , but are made to create a reservation .
I would also like to reiterate that , as previous speakers have said , we need to hand over our hand to third countries .
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential , although it concerns only 1 % of health budgets because , beyond the figures , what we should focus on is its symbolic force , which is the legitimate right of every European citizen to be treated abroad and reimbursed for treatment , with all the relevant information .
However , as a form of primary prevention , I call for measures that encourage healthy lifestyles to be applied as an essential factor in improving health .
In view of the different laws of the Member States and the limited possibility of implementing the provisions of international law on combating violence against women , it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a need to introduce binding legislation at European level .
What is your position on these unpreventive liabilities within the euro system ?
Freedom of expression and information , including the freedom to express opinions and the freedom to receive and communicate information without interference or pressure , are social values for which many people have fought over the years , including in Portugal .
We need to create more green jobs ; we need to support investment in research and innovation .
In short , as we have said many times , we need a solid , well-funded cohesion policy in all the regions of the European Union .
In general , I share some of these concerns and recognise that Turkmenistan has to work even further before it is fully compliant with international standards of democracy and respect for human rights .
An ever-increasing number of companies are relocating , benefiting from lower labour costs in various countries , particularly China and India , with harmful effects on countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Ladies and gentlemen , I appeal to the members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) in particular , to us to defend one group or another in Ukraine for political and party reasons .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Mr President , the Arab world is our partner in the Union for the Mediterranean .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , with whom I share very similar views on the programme , but also to congratulate all those who have worked together , because at a time of economic crisis such as this , it is vital to maintain such a programme , the social effects of which are , of course , positive .
The Commission has every intention of establishing a special relationship with Parliament on this dossier as well .
Mr President , Commissioners , we must ensure that the promises of donation made at the conference in New York are translated into actual appropriations and reaches the intended recipients .
It is this committee that defines the citizen-centred policy , which is needed particularly in the context of the current crisis .
The European Council must prepare the necessary preparations , without stepping up any similar conclusions .
If Portugal did not witness the closure of companies with a virtually weekly drop , then there would be so many Portuguese unemployed and the death of poverty .
With the creation of a trust fund , as proposed by the European Socialist Party , Member States attacked by unscrupulous speculators would be supported without a duty to use taxpayers and we could ensure more spreading .
Among the new cases of breaches recorded in 2007 , 1 196 were related to a lack of notification of national measures concerning the transposition of Community directives .
I believe that a balance needs to be found between protecting the environment , the administrative burden and the costs involved for industrial and small plants , such as farmers and health facilities .
The EIB is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of the strategy .
( ES ) Madam President , thank you and congratulations to my fellow Member , Mrs Weber , for the excellent work he has done with this report .
I am pleased to see that Parliament and the Commission share many priorities in this case .
In fact , it offers the big monopolies on a silver curse of international and internal transport by road .
- Report : Klaus-Heiner Lehne
In my opinion , this type of intensive farming with the use of antibiotics must be very limited in the European Union and perhaps even eliminated .
The protection of migrant workers who , as a principle , are obliged to work in unacceptable conditions , are complaining about this directive .
I welcome the fact that this proposal was rejected , given that it was only because the Left could attack his political opponents in Italy .
You are quite right .
There is no doubt that there has been a lot of discussion in the Council about how to prevent the peripheral Member States from being excluded and ultimately formed a qualified majority , and I hope that the same thing will happen in Parliament , too , as would prove to be the case today .
Amendment 43 does not mean that Amendment 54 falls , because it also addresses other issues , which are outside the EU .
Order of business
Climate change is not the only environmental problem facing us , but it is essential that we try and address it in Copenhagen .
However , there is no need for a new body to establish , define or control conditionality .
- ( HU ) I welcome the Council &apos;s decision on the position to be presented at the G20 .
We must try to find out whether we need new sources of income , where we only need to look at those who have always benefited from this despicable situation .
I have consistently voted against a large number of reports submitted to me .
This has cost unnecessarily the job losses of one million British citizens .
The Globalisation Adjustment Fund has now become an instrument that is increasingly being used by the European Parliament , due to the difficult economic convergence that our continent is going through .
I call on Judge Afiuni and all the prisoners in Venezuela to be treated with dignity and to be judged in a thorough and fair trial .
Some Members have asked for Gaza , for the importance of aid to come into practice , to continue to support the local population , all that we do , but we have been engaged in a dialogue to improve the situation .
I also voted in favour of this report because it calls for a European Union funding system that is more transparent , simpler and fairer .
Although the European Union must have relations with the Russian Government , it must , at every opportunity , remind the Russian Government of our request that a state and a democratic ethos prevail , and that the European Union is not prepared to accept any censorship of invisible opinions and that the government or exerted pressure on politicians .
( NL ) Mr President , unfortunately , in Copenhagen , the giants , the United States , China , India and Brazil , have not joined a European giant .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am convinced that research and innovation are not an option for Europe , but an option if we want a long-term solution to protect the social model and the sustainability of the environment .
It is clear that the intention is to maintain its raw materials and to achieve more attractive exchange rates for their exports .
Please play your game !
Developing countries are rightly saying that they have not been granted the crisis .
With regard to this path , the European Union must play its part in starting time and in appropriate forms a technical reflection on possible measures complementary to UN sanctions , while at the same time reiterating its readiness to compare and dialogue , which , even in difficult times , should never be lost .
As the current directive does not seem to be sufficiently effective in discouraging fatalities , I also support the strengthening of existing rules .
Since then , it has become clear that the United States is much more open than we imagined to be more open to such reserves and to finding constructive solutions than Europe &apos;s concerns .
Commissioner Rehn , who is here , said that the Irish people will not be allowed to hold general elections before they have approved the budget .
I would like to emphasise one rather bizarre aspect : in the United States , the use of squals in assisting spouses has been banned , but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it because a large part of the vaccines contain squalms .
The most effective instrument available to the European Union for combating unemployment is the European Social Fund , whose rules are now subject to a major simplification process aimed at accelerating payments .
I believe that we must now give these measures the time to be transposed and implemented at national level and assess the results before we establish whether further action is needed .
New areas have been added in order to strengthen cooperation : the fight against terrorism and organised crime ; the prevention of merchant activities ; the fight against the fight against production , trade and the accumulation of light and small arms ; and cooperation in the area of migration .
I believe that the lack of democratic control over this issue has a negative impact on the transparency of development policy .
The first is that , despite all the concern and fear of people , we must not lose sight of the principles .
The resolution is explicitly referred to and criticised for measures applied by the current government , forgetting that the current mayor of Naples Ierfin belongs to the centre left or , worse still , forgetting the long Bassolino , Mayor of Naples from 1993 to 2000 and Governor of Campania , as well as for many years of the extraordinary waste emergency Commissioner .
It will once again fight for democracy .
In addition to what has already been said about the precautionary principle and the importance of traceability ( the first point ) , it is also a question of knowing how this general alert , which elects the Spanish cucumbers to culminate without any proof , or almost any proof , can be drawn .
On this point , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the report lacks its objective , because it still lays down too many conditions for prior authorisation , making life difficult for Member States .
The future of this region needs sound , tolerant democracies that respect minorities and in which the state is promised to everyone and not abused by a few .
I very much hope that Estonia will join the euro area on 1 January 2011 so as to create an economic growth area and to resolve financial difficulties .
Therefore , in general , the vast majority of stakeholders , including professional associations , agree on the opportunity to use only English .
The only sensible alternative for workers and workers is to disobstruct and disregard the decisions taken by the European Union and its institutions .
At the same time , political dialogue now has reason to be suspended .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I propose an oral amendment in favour of a split vote on paragraph 10 which states that the European Parliament &apos; does not consider it appropriate to include this in the protocol complementary rules on racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and all forms of discrimination &apos; .
We need to raise the target and we will raise it , but only when the circumstances are right .
It is essential that we in the European Union act now .
As for financial services , it is true that the suppliers of these services must ensure a degree of transparency , but I have some doubts about the wording used in your proposal .
The budget on which the report is based - and it was included in the first point of the preamble of the compromise proposal , which enshrines the end of the milk quota system - is unacceptable to us , which is why we voted against this text .
Madam President , this really is good news .
We will not miss our efforts to make it clearer .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say that I cannot make a speech in Catalan , although the language of more than 10 million European citizens is still not an official language .
The EU must modernise its energy infrastructure and include the interconnection between Member States &apos; infrastructure .
If Russia is unable to accept Ukraine &apos;s political orientation , it will have to overcome this inability as it has overcome the loss of political influence on the countries of the Soviet bloc .
In this respect , I would like to mention the decision made today in plenary to adopt a resolution on the case of Aminatou Haidar so as not to undermine the ongoing diplomatic talks .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , we are discussing the situation in Belarus , and we are not joking on the buck .
The main producer countries , supported by the majority of Members of this House who are sensitive to the industry &apos;s arguments , have succeeded in preventing an ambitious target of reducing emissions from being met .
We have worked very well to reach what I think is a very strong report , which sets out a clear vision of the guidelines that Parliament intends to give to the CAP after 2013 .
The example of the United States is that flexibility is not synonymous with insecurity , but rather with dynamism in the labour market .
As President of the European Commission , I will endorse the principles set out in the resolution that you have just adopted .
We must now send a clear signal in terms of responsibility to those who have the future of this key treaty in their hands for the Union , for our institutions and for the 500 million Europeans that we represent .
These are examples of the benefits of animal research .
Documents received : see Minutes
Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work , because , in addition to the EUR 146 million that we hope will produce the eighteen effects , this initiative is of symbolic value .
I believe that Europe &apos;s cultural spirit is an important means of bringing Europeans closer together in a way that fully respects their different cultural and linguistic identities .
I think it is extremely important to promote not only the competitiveness of the agricultural sector , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution .
Special payments have also been granted to rural areas and islands , such as , for example , Orkney and Shetland , in my constituency , where longer travel times are inevitable .
The policies implemented are irritating and disappointing our citizens and the decision-making process discourage their participation , as the recent European elections have shown .
As far as the delay is concerned , you are right : there has been a delay .
The resolution calls on the Commission to respond urgently to the legitimate concerns of the petitioner , who has been in this intolerable situation for 13 years and has consequently suffered considerable loss of earnings , and to take the necessary action to allow the petitioner to assert his rights .
The key elements for achieving these objectives are full support , effective implementation and sufficient respect for current standards and instruments linked to the protection of human rights and civil liberties .
From now on , the European project has been subjected to such a harsh test .
What will we do when the Americans , with the trump dollar , are selling their cars 4x4 major cransom , subsidised and strongly encouraged on our market , including those of low level vehicles from Turkey , India and China ?
Mr President , I would like to ask you for an evaluation of the EU-Ukraine Summit which took place almost two weeks ago .
We are calling for common , European solutions .
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out , the Commission should consult the European Parliament when it gives a mandate .
It is extremely important that we , as Europeans , ensure that we bring the European message to Belarus , too , and that we give it a hope .
The new European Neighbourhood Policy that has been promised to us is roughly the same , with a few more backbone blocks of a democratic nature .
Of course , these measures offer only a partial and incomplete solution to illegal immigration and black work .
Let me not delude you : let us say very clearly , I personally say to all the leaders that I have to meet , and I do so with the support of the House and the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States .
It is no exaggeration : one of these reports makes it clear that , in the event of a majority change after an election , the new government must obtain an authorisation before amending the budgetary priorities of the previous government , and even if it obtains can only make marginal changes .
Indeed , while our political differences have obviously not changed , our human relationship has been greatly enriched .
It is therefore important for us to go beyond the pilot project that you mentioned , Commissioner .
In summary , nuclear energy is managed so that every country has a nuclear safety regulator that is fully responsible for the application of nuclear safety provisions .
However , the interesting thing is that , although it is true that several countries are having problems as a result of the financial crisis , it is also true , as I think that Mr Lamberts will recognise and appreciate , that in most countries , governments are not Socialists .
Several scenarios are possible , from the assumption of peaceful power by pro-democracy forces to the economic chaos and the outbreak of an armed conflict , to the use of nuclear weapons , which cannot be excluded .
In our society , which is ageing , the number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer &apos;s or chloromethane will continue to grow .
With regard to the issue of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the issue of the amendments to the European Social Fund , I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation that it was so constructive that the achievement of our objectives was so constructive that it was reached at this meeting , and I consider this to be an extremely important fact .
You spoke about the difficulty with the Commission and the budgetary authority : do you not need to encourage the Member States to start taking the measures that are the subject of the application to the EGF immediately after the submission of the proposal so as to ensure at least that workers are not waiting for the mobilisation of the fund ?
However , they cannot remain on paper alone , because they will only underline the inconsistency and lack of trust in the acts adopted by the European Union itself .
I cannot imagine how we can feel comfortable in making a concession to this oppressive regime by supporting amendments that offer the opportunity for Iran to attack and weaken an opposition movement which fought for human rights and democracy in Iran .
I voted against the introduction of EU contract law as I believe that Brussels must not bring about new legislation where there is already a national right .
With his election , he brought hope and change , not only in the United States , but throughout the world , including Europe .
To this end , I support the proposals that the Commission has submitted to Parliament , many of which have already been addressed in my report on the Community Code on Borders .
However , we oppose the wording of paragraph 8 , which makes provision for a gradual and decisive reduction in the tax burden on average wages and pensions , with tax depressions , revisions of rates and restitution of taxation .
In the many cases where the government has long been unable to take part in dialogue or programmes aimed at improving the situation , the specific resolutions per country are the only action that remains on the international community to combat these crimes .
We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new Parliament .
However , these exemptions should only be applied if they prove to be of relevance to the security policy .
The Copts have also called on the LTTE to lay down their arms , but unfortunately this call has been rejected , if not ignored .
I agree with the possibility of calling for structural reforms in countries with surpluses , but particular attention must be given to those countries with deficits .
Therefore , I would like to request a roll-call vote on the second part of paragraph 12 .
However , I welcome the determination with which our Parliament , by a large majority , has taken up this issue along the lines that we have adopted .
That is the European route , perhaps different from all the others .
The project , known as ESVAC ( European monitoring of antimicrobial consumption as veterinary medicines ) , started in the third quarter of 2009 .
Given the crucial role played by research in economic development and job creation , it is important to avoid all costs excessive bureaucracy and unjustified delays , which prevent the scientific community from participating in it .
The banks are black , yet they are bold when they are known that they are making a certain contribution to Greece on a voluntary basis .
This document shows that Member States are increasingly effectively implementing the transposition of Community law .
The best way to contain the increase in population is to save the lives of young people so that we do not feel the need to have more families .
I therefore welcome the proposal to establish clear rules for the definition of these types of wine , so as to make the high quality of European production increasingly recognisable and identifiable .
An initiative will only be successful if it is easily workable and accessible to everyone .
In my opinion , special attention must be paid to the corridor 7 .
Therefore , I welcome this communication , which highlights a new ambition in Single Market policies , allowing us to restore confidence in the model of the social market economy .
( The speaker agreed to take the floor under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As you know , the second round of presidential elections took place in Ukraine on Sunday .
The Hungarian Government must provide concrete guarantees for freedom and pluralism in the media , which is why it should repeal the law or amend it substantially , taking into account the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe and the Council of the European Union , and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights , through open and transparent debate , not all the parties involved , and non-governmental organisations .
The Prüm Treaty has been forcibly introduced into EU law without proper democratic scrutiny .
I would also like to remind the liberal colleagues , Mrs Rohde in particular , that her support was motivated by the devastating effects of free trade ; according to Marx , disregarded interests that were promoting British Borghesia were of little importance , and Indian society had to be destroyed to rectify the start of the global revolution .
Kenya acts in full violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human and Peoples .
Firstly , civil protection is a Member State competence , and any coordination initiative must start with this assumption .
In 2008 , the UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote : &apos; The killings removed the leaders of civil society , including human rights defenders , trade unionists and propping the agrarian reform , intimidated by many of the protagonists of civil society and restricted political debate &apos; .
I do not agree with the last speaker because I believe that , if we approve the Treaty of Lisbon , it will give us the opportunity to contact the citizens and the European Union much more constructively .
We have achieved beer as civilisation and as weapons , all the more so than in the Cold War , which should encourage us to adopt pragmatic policies aimed at promoting militarisation .
In this way , we can say that we want real and effective economic governance that benefits all Member States .
I am convinced - and this is a good message that I will be happy if this House follows our lead with such an overwhelming majority , I hope - that we have managed to show that control works .
We have also endeavoured to make our desire , as clear as possible , to have not only public channels with high-quality and activating content , but also to see integration with new platforms , always taking account of the latest technologies .
Madam President , two years ago in Ireland , in December 2008 , we had a problem .
Although we cannot expect miracles from the agreement , it is a step in the right direction , which is why I voted in favour of this report .
Once again , this is a separate intergovernmental mechanism within the Ecofin , which requires unanimity .
This goes against the specific objective of regional aid , namely the strengthening of the weaker regions .
This is the goal that we should pursue together .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
But only a clear commitment from the Libyan authorities will enable us to take action what is necessary .
This is , of course , a strong signal that we are sending out to the future new institutions : to Parliament , of course , but also to the Commission .
There is also a danger that real criminals will adapt to profiling and use people from the innocent side such as drug comriers or suicide bombers or use alternative travel routes to monitored travel routes .
Better access to schools , high-quality vocational training courses , universities and improving the social situation of women in rural areas are other essential elements .
Despite this other challenges , there are still challenges .
EPAs cannot be considered satisfactory unless they promote regional integration and contribute to development in the ACP countries , as well as to achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
In my opinion , the most important point in this regard is the need to agree on a new budget for Europe and for the European Union in the coming years .
The EU must prioritise research and innovation , in tackling challenges such as climate change and in devising the solutions needed to increase global competition .
Europe is divided on this point .
This is good news , for which we must thank all those who , within the Member States and sometimes the regions , are responsible for implementing this directive .
According to the UN , between 20 % and 40 % of world production of timber comes from illegal logging .
I know that you are about to leave Parliament and , although we do not always agree , I think that everyone agrees that you have done a good job in this report .
This proposal , supported by the Council of Europe , has long been awaited by all those who strive to ensure that the rights of integration of marginalised communities are respected , especially the Roma population .
Otherwise , any act of this Parliament taken on the basis of a Parliament made up of 754 Members , three beyond the 751 limit , would be illegal .
The subject is also key to the digital agenda , which we have debated not so long ago , and which is the unanimous consensus on .
I would like to thank you for having made this debate a fully-fledged joint debate .
Commissioner Rehn reminds us all that full cooperation with the ICTY is one of the conditions for EU membership , but the truth is , as Commissioner Orban said last evening , without Commissioner Rehn , that there is no unanimity in the Council on what that means .
The Arctic Council devoted mainly to environmental cooperation and research , but the agreements focusing on the use of natural resources have determined the growing need to develop international administration strategies , and the EU could also play a part in this .
However , I strongly support a very selective approach to access to the road transport operator .
As we have opened up our markets when we joined the European Union , we must pay the same money in the budget and in many other initiatives .
Unfortunately , at the moment , there is no European mechanism or institution capable of coordinating an integrated recovery for the continent and , as a result , we are resorting to positive solutions that could , as a whole , fail , because the economies of the Member States are strongly interdependent .
I must say , however , that as far as our communication is concerned , we have set out a clear definition of price stability so that everyone can actually judge what we do in real time .
With regard to judicial training , the Council agrees with Parliament that it is necessary to encourage the creation of a genuine judicial culture within the European Union , among other things , through the promotion of direct trade between judges , prosecutors and judicial operators of different Member States , as well as the development of a European judicial training network ( REFG ) .
We must make a joint effort in this direction in the future .
However , this is not the case .
However , I would like to remind this House of a problem which has recently been experienced by Greece in some important cases , namely the fact that still people are persecuted for serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union disappear or are still able to get rid of it and avoid arrest using the various national laws and regulations .
There is a general framework in which the individual elements can be complementary and mutually reinforcing .
Before the vote :
From today &apos;s debate , the following message must be sent out to the Member States : Romania and Bulgaria meet the same criteria of accession that the European Union has applied to the countries which have so far been admitted to the region .
I believe that the implementation of European contract law , which has been going on for a long time in the institutions , may lead to a number of benefits for businesses , consumers and the smooth functioning of the internal market .
It is politically unacceptable that this report , which contains incorrect facts , was voted on in plenary today ( 24 November 2009 ) .
Certainly , we cannot criticise the United States for years on the basis of Guantánamo and then not demonstrate much willingness or ambition on our part to help them resolve this problem .
That is why we voted against it .
The phenomenon of migration caused by crisis and instability has negative implications for destination countries and for people who have been displaced .
Madam President , I do not know what has happened , but I would like to speak as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
In the case of Serbia , liberalisation will not include the residents of Kosovo or the original people of Kosovo who live abroad and have a Serbian passport issued by a central Belgrade passport , for which the visa requirement will continue .
Passengers should be able to choose between receiving reimbursement of the ticket price or continuing their journey to the same conditions and without additional costs .
Ensure that there are binding targets in the field of energy efficiency and that they are actually respected .
I tabled this question on behalf of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport and Tourism , at the request of the same members , which , last summer , expressed great concern at the failure of the airline SkyEurope .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
Firstly , overcoming the imbalances resulting from the ever-increasing differences between life expectancy and retirement age .
Proposals :
Our debate is about the possibility of implementing all the details in Mexico , including the very form of the agreement .
The OSCE is quickly taking the place of the Council of Europe as a Prince for discussing democracy and the rule of law in Europe , while the ODIHR deals with election observation operations .
The compromise is satisfactory and I very much hope that tomorrow &apos;s vote will receive broad support .
I recently reminded the House that Belarus does not have free elections , that freedom of expression , assembly and demonstration do not exist and that more and more acts of repression by the authorities are increasingly increasing .
A scientifically substantiated claim should be given consideration to the complex scientific data available and should evaluate evidence elements .
Of course , this information is very important for patients and healthcare workers , but as a result of the potential promotional abuse , it requires a strict framework .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the repetition of accidents and the increase in the transport of hazardous goods by sea constantly raise serious problems with regard to the strengthening of the safety rules governing all seafarers in the European Union and the resources required to apply these rules .
The second issue is nuclear energy .
Then there will be the technical part , including transposition into a legally binding text .
Therefore , it is crucial that the social clause increasingly comprises in bilateral agreements .
We therefore have a good opportunity to demonstrate this from the practical side .
Tuesday :
To promote this practical cooperation , the 2008 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum called for the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office , which was later agreed in 2009 with the Stockholm Programme .
We are celebrating 8 March this week .
Madam President , thank you to the honourable Member for his comment , but I would remind you that I am a representative of Poland and not Lithuania .
Mr President , I am pleased that the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs can be presented in plenary , contrary to what happened a few weeks ago .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs García Pérez , Mrs Jöns and Mr Angelaka , for their excellent reports , and all the Members who have spoken .
I know that this has been followed by many Members of this House , as well as by national parliaments .
We will therefore work to reiterate our call to Russia to do its utmost to ensure that human rights defenders are able to do their work without having to live in fear of violence , harassment or threats .
In addition , pointless complications could undermine the legitimacy and popularity of the Union &apos;s accession process to the Convention .
Opening of the sitting
We must stop exerting pressure on the Tunisian Government , which has many other problems : refugees - as has been said - and the democratic transition process under way .
We must continue economic , social and territorial cohesion policies in order to reduce the disparities between regions and to create a balanced economic development platform , as also mentioned in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The next item is the vote .
The human rights groups accused Google of helping the Chinese Government repression of their citizens and , in particular , human rights activists .
The most important issue at the moment is to change the proposed directive quickly and to implement it as soon as possible .
In the face of this , I propose , as I have done in the past , that a European Eastern Neighbourhood Assembly be established , with the participation of the European Parliament based on the principles of Euromed assemblies and EuroLat , in order to implement the ENPI in Eastern European countries .
The main issue that we must focus on is financing the European budget and future financial perspectives .
Instead , we will have to inform citizens about the implications of the directive , explaining to them how we use the tools we have created so that they do not fall into the trap of buying falsified medicines .
It is vital to create true level playing field for credit rating agencies , by promoting competition , transparency , opening up the market and stability .
It is currently estimated that 200 000 to 300 000 children are directly injured into armed conflicts in more than 20 countries around the world .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Espinosa , Commissioner , the Spanish Presidency has decided to prepare an assessment of the Copenhagen climate conference , but we are here , in fact , saying that it has , in many speakers , been resolved in a fiasco .
These improvements are a key means of promoting the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) in the future .
Commissioner , you mentioned the Lisbon Strategy , innovation , the green economy , but you know that this European strategy is not working .
No , you want to continue to pay out export refunds .
( DE ) Madam President , any country considers its origins and the possibility of assessing whether the development of human and minority rights in the region is going in the right direction .
It is also essential that the legislation encourages fishing companies to use the best available equipment in terms of selectivity , so as to avoid capturing large amounts of undersized fish , different species and by-catches .
We will continue to insist that this is the case .
As the Commissioner rightly pointed out , for many years , our largest competitors and economic partners have a designation of origin for products coming into their territory .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Tuesday , 20 May , at 12 : 00 .
While the European Union supports the Copenhagen proposals in order to encourage the deindustrialisation of the West and the business domination of the Third World , an ever-increasing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as a fraudster of the elite - an excuse for taxing and controlling us and imposing intergovernmental dogma and the global government at the expense of the nation state .
We also maintain constant contacts with third countries , particularly with Russia , in order to call for their bans to be eliminated , which we consider to be just as inappropriate .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Hahn , the proposals under discussion amount to a very poor zaine being put on the shoulders of those who are already in trouble and tell them that they need to move faster .
Once again , I pay tribute to their courage and determination .
At the same time , the consequences of the irresponsible budgetary policy that has so far been adopted in many Member States will also have an impact on the European Union in the future .
The first reason is that science is global discipline and that progress we can share is to increase the total human commitment .
Let us do so with the rules .
With grassroots support in free fall and the combination of severe austerity measures , the Romanian Government is using increasingly undemocratic methods to maintain power .
Let us reclaim the utopia and the utopia for peace !
The European Union is still on the right track and , through controls and transparency , we want to achieve the 20 % target , ensuring that nothing goes wrong in Europe .
The White Paper also proposes further funding opportunities for projects in this area , namely the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development , the Community Programme for Public Health , the Giovenu and Cittinanza programmes , as well as the Lifelong Learning Programme .
As the committee is composed of seven members alone and their task is of enormous responsibility , it is important that these are irresponsible and highly qualified people .
Even if we are not able to offer them the prospect of their membership in the near future , we must develop economic and political cooperation for the common good of the whole of Europe .
Following a public consultation held last year , the Commission is now evaluating the remarks made on collective redress in order to find a solution that meets the needs of European consumers without imports of US practices .
Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens and the best form of active dialogue with European citizens is about listening to what they say in the democratic elections .
I think this evening &apos;s debate has shown the exceptional unit of views of this House , for example , on the appointment of a special coordinator of the European Union for Tibet .
I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities on the territory of the European Union as equal to all EU citizens .
This is an excellent example and a point of reference , as I said , but also a old lesson from the second poorest country in the world : coming to court , we have read the slogan &apos; there is no peace without justice &apos; .
In this situation , cooperation between the EU and the Council is crucial to ensuring that energy needs are covered and that the price of crude oil is not rising on the world market .
If we do not give a clear answer to all these questions , the two objectives of growth in employment and the reduction of poverty will suffer the same fate as the Lisbon Agenda .
- Before the vote :
He says Mr Amado : &apos; I have not mentioned this to disrupt the European institutions &apos; .
I hope that 2010 will be a good year for Croatia and also for the Western Balkans , but I would also like to stress that we need to look at and address the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons , as highlighted in the latest report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
I know that it is not easy .
Madam President , I would like to join those who have called on the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to present a new proposal based on a different legal basis .
There are many review clauses to ensure the functioning of the measure , but I echo Mrs Wallis &apos;s statement that the exceptions were decisive for reaching the compromise .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s position that it is the Member States that are responsible for safe management , including the disposal , spent fuel and radioactive waste from their products , by developing their programmes .
I believe that this text represents an additional instrument for the EU to devise a coherent and effective policy on the phenomenon of migration flows , steering choices on the right track to restore conditions of political , economic and social stability .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank everyone for their expressions of support and their comments , including those who opposed this report .
Our third objective was to simplify and facilitate access to financing instruments for the SME sector .
At the same time , Ukraine must speed up the adoption of reforms .
I would like to emphasise the interest the rapporteur has shown in relation to young people , which is a shared interest of his whole group .
We use our work to uphold these rights and freedoms , based on the treaties , and we will continue to do so .
The number of errors has decreased , but we have not yet reached the &apos; tolerable level of error &apos; .
Too many children are poor and have to face up to health and education problems that are rooted in persistent poverty .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is almost a political provocation to present to us the Europe 2020 programme as a great strategy for emerging from the crisis .
We have agreed on five objectives , including social inclusion , which is a competence of the European Union recognised by the Treaty .
Recently , we have been able to understand the importance of the problem of the legislation that has been adopted by observing that millions of families throughout the European Union have replaced their Catalan television with modern screens with LCD .
We must invest in our neighbouring countries , especially the eastern neighbours of the European Union , and we must provide them with the incentives to continue reforms and to strengthen the European Union &apos;s presence in the region .
It is very important to establish the most effective criteria , given the growing number of equipment produced and the impact of the equipment on health and the environment when they are not properly treated at the end of their lives .

The report takes a comprehensive approach to the issue of forests , focusing on certain aspects that we consider to be important .
The Commissioner said that there was provision for the Geneva Agreement - let us remember that we are talking about the tariff rate of EUR 114 .
It is clear that most of these initiatives will be the responsibility of the governments of Serbia and Macedonia , as Commissioner Malmström has pointed out , because these countries are the ones who are the ones who need to provide information to their citizens .
In the context of the difficult situation in the market and the discussion that we have had about the future of agricultural policy in the EU , Parliament must make a clear commitment to ensuring that all areas of agricultural production can plan for the future .
What measures does you intend to take with regard to &apos; the activity &apos; of rating agencies ?
It is worth pointing out that volunteering has , without doubt , a positive influence on European identity , which is still in the process of being rooted in these values , and is a solid basis for disseminating understanding between citizens of different social groups and countries throughout European society .
Ladies and gentlemen , the proposed amendment to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is one of the most important measures approved by the European Parliament , both because it improves the quality of life of European citizens and because it is lost in favour of the European Union &apos;s economic recovery .
The previous presidencies promised Belgium that Parliament would participate in the debate on the multiannual financial framework .
Part of spectrum to new entrants may be an appropriate instrument in some cases , but we must avoid pointless procedures so that we can move towards one another .
No one would understand and whether the amendments were adopted as a result of the proposal would be exactly the opposite .
Institutional aspects of establishing a European External Action Service - Establishing a European External Action Service : the state of negotiations with the Member States ( debate )
When you hide behind the mystery and Manicheo language , the aim is clear : the Union does not accept the affirmation of the sovereignty of Belarus and its establishment of an independent policy , which did not stand up for the interests of the EU / NATO / US , and is attempting to elude it .
The report recommends , in particular , that the education and training of medical and paramedical staff be promoted by paying particular attention to nosocomial infections and to the resistance to the antivirals of virus that cause them ; improving the knowledge of this problem among patients , by asking the Commission to draw up a document targeted at nursing infections and the resistance to nursing infections caused by the virus ; and by increasing the presence of nanotoxide infections in the workplace of nanotoxide , in 2003 , in particular , and in the World Health Organisation ( WHA ) ) ; and in particular , in the field of health care of nanital Applications ) ; and in the New Deturses ) ; and in the New Neturses ) ) ) ;

( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it remains a mystery that the Council has been able to take such a light on such a subject .
Although the EU budget has been a major political lever , the ceiling of EU own resources has been unchanged since 1993 .

Mr Maystadt held a conference two days ago in which he outlined the EIB &apos;s expenditure from the start of the crisis , in other words , around EUR 10 billion more than the previous year .
I also agree with the possibility of Member States adopting provisions and measures that are more effective than those contained in the agreement for the protection of workers , which I would add , is also very welcome .
Mr Oettinger , at the moment , you are preparing the Energy Roadmap for 2050 .
The rebates that the UK receives and that the Dutch and Danish people would like to be a failed system .

With today &apos;s vote , the mandate for the trialogue for the 2012 budget was approved .
This report and the same debate can make a valuable contribution in the future when we can discuss the problem on a wider scale .

I would like to ask the Commission whether this is going to be included in the amended version of the communication and whether the relevant responsibilities will be adequately allocated , in this case to the Member States , even though they will be co-signed , in their activities , by the rules for services of general interest , which should be drawn up together with the European Parliament and the Council .
We should have set a threshold value , but we have not managed to do so now , and we must continue to hope and hope for success .
For the Chilean part , no request has been reached for this , but of course the entire amount could be used for this purpose .
The hope is that the Commission and the Council will work consistently on this , and especially with a timeliness that , in other circumstances , too , is unfortunately guilty of a lack of charge .
After all , the intention is to criminalise Communists , their activities and their ideals .
If , however , prevents our greeting , the volcano could cause the European economy more damage than expected .

Mr President , I would like to express my solidarity and fraternity with the Chilean people following the terrible earthquakes and tsunami that struck Concepción , Biobío , Temuco and Valparaíso on .
It is not just a question of regulation and of structures , but of mentality .
According to the latest statistics , the EU has registered a trade deficit of EUR 17.3 billion in August 2010 .
At the end of the day , respect for these commitments will be crucial to the progressive recovery of our financial support programmes .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Request for a opinion of the Court of Justice on the compatibility of the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement ( motion for a resolution tabled ) : see Minutes
This was , in itself , a challenge .
It also made it clear that in times of crisis , it is not possible to act alone to ensure the wellbeing of our citizens .
In many ways , I admire the fundamental positions of my group .
This is a fairly significant step forward , in the right direction .
Can the Commission outline to what extent will it take account of such sentences , which show once again that the Commission is more mistaken , that Regulation ( EC ) No 261 / 2004 on &apos; extraordinary circumstances &apos; justifies cancellation and the passivity of the Commission in the face of numerous violations of this regulation is damaging to passengers ?

( LT ) Madam President , I believe that the evaluation of the Services Directive gave us a good opportunity to see whether this directive actually facilitates better development of the services market and whether the Member States are implementing the provisions contained in it properly .
in writing . - ( HU ) I welcome the measures proposed by the European Commission to help producers in the European dairy sector .
There is one thing that we should stop doing : ridiculous Greece .
Perhaps the Commission is full of ideas , or is not able to act , because there is resistance on the part of the European Council , a sense that has been known for too long now .
That is why I voted for the report on the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living Living and Working Conditions .
This must be managed , and the resolution adopted today is useful in this respect .
The Commission will take the lead in the work done by the European Institute for Gender Equality , which will collect and analyse the relevant data and statistics .
Moreover , these measures would harm the Union &apos;s foreign trade policy , making it harder to conclude future bilateral and multilateral trade agreements .
However , given that the report contains very reasonable arguments in this area , I voted in favour of this text .
Therefore , the country that is head of the free world cannot abandon these values for reasons of convenience , even if it is understandable to security concerns .

In the case of the European Economic and Social Committee ( ESE ) , the control carried out by the Court of Auditors has not found any serious irregularities .
I would also like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the reports by Mr Peneda and Mr Lambert have been adopted .
( FR ) Mr President , Prime Minister , when you presented the Belgian Presidency &apos;s programme in July last year , I said to you that you , you were joking and you welcome , that you would perhaps still be there in January to present the results .
We welcome the fact that our ban on substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic for reproduction has been kept more appropriate and made more appropriate .
I welcome the timely action of the Commission and Parliament and I call for the immediate implementation of the new directive .
It is a symbol of solidarity and a victory for national egoism .
In the context of the global financial crisis and the growing level of consumer debt , active dialogue with European citizens results in an effort by the European institutions and civil society to improve consumer financial knowledge , particularly with regard to rights and obligations and best practices concerning savings and loans .
A framework agreement will be prepared and a rapid decision-making mechanism will be established on the scope of the assistance .
We cannot allow enlargement to be postponed for political reasons .
1. it is time to identify all the media present on the Internet ;
There is no disagreement between communitarianism and intergovernmental , between merits and quotas , between the old and the new Member States .
You do not count on me to approve any increase in the budget .
I voted in favour of this report so that these objectives become a reality in the near future , by stimulating harmonious growth not only in the various areas , but also in the areas of Europe that are often characterised by inequality at levels of territorial development .
We therefore ask you today to accept our request to remind this very active journalist in the fight for freedom and human rights in Chechnya and observe a minute &apos;s silence .

Today , the number of people living below the poverty line ( 79 million ) is equal to that of the beginning of the century .
I am pleased that the European Parliament has taken an active role in monitoring the waste management situation in Campania , as shown , for example , by the report adopted by the Committee on Petitions after its visit to the region last April last year .
These people very often show antipathy to others , feel alienated and are afraid of the disapproval of society .
Like many , I , too , have continuous concerns about the transfer of data blocs and the monitoring of this data when it is transmitted .
- Report : Paulo Casaca
In order to improve this issue , it is necessary to improve their skills , for example , by allocating European funds more effectively to policies aimed at young people .
To be honest , I find it astonishing that we are now having to take a almost defensive line of argument because we cannot consider this issue on the basis of the Euratom regulations alone , but we must also bear in mind the protection of consumers , the protection of the population in the event of serious accidents in the context of the rules of the European Treaty , so that we have absolute control and our voice on the final outcome .
It calls for European energy security to work closely with NATO .
We believe that the European Union and the European Commission must be much more stringent as regards the values that can lead us to a project of peace and shared prosperity .
However , you can count on my commitment .
By November this year , all Member States must introduce criminal sanctions for racism and xenophobia , as stipulated in the framework decision .
I would like to call on the country to commit itself more decisively than to employment and social cohesion policies .
The financing of land ownership in developing countries must be reviewed as a result of the EIB &apos;s external lending mandate .
The European Union can play an important role in this context and it is its right and duty to insist on strict compliance with high environmental requirements , as I assume that other equally dangerous reservoirs also exist in other Member States .
As I was also the rapporteur for the only report by a European institution on earthquakes , I know that much can and must still be done at European level .
I now come to the Commission as a whole .
Institutional cooperation must be fair , logical and democratic .
In my opinion , waiting until July , not to allow the appointment and wait for the proposals that we are about to discuss now , was a wise decision .
Mrs Mavrommatis has set out a number of points that we are soon aware of , but I think that a period of 70 years is the best possible solution .
Under EU legislation , passengers are entitled to information and assistance from airlines .
( LT ) Madam President , the report on amending the Council Regulation on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community is presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .

In Egypt and Libya , the EU cannot remain silent and must do more to protect women and children , as well as the principle of the rule of law for all .
I have the pleasure of already being able to account for the first measures taken as a result of the Council .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is a plenary sitting , so please keep quiet and let us move on with the one-minute speeches .
However , the decisions that fall under the responsibility of all the Member States of the euro area must not be left to the fund .
We insist that assisting spouses should be made compulsory , as in the case of self-employed workers .
Moreover , given that the government no longer had any access to the financial markets , without this support , fiscal policy would have been even more restrictive than it is in fact vain through the programme , whereas spending limits would be much tougher .
As an example of one of these dogmas , I would mention the recent article by Václav Klaus , which suggests how to overcome the financial crisis by temporarily softening social , environmental and health parameters , because they impede , he advocates , rational human behaviour .
It is important that we define clear guidelines and move them forward , including on behalf of Austria .
Consumers and professional workers will have to remove paint strippers using one of the alternative chemical substances available , which are equally effective but also innocured , or , for example , using techniques of tropical / thermal winter .
This time , after a long debate , Ireland , a small country like Finland , has sought refuge in the European Union and wants to help strengthen it .
From the point of view of budgetary controls , which currently focus on the results and actual performance of European programmes and institutions , the EIB has undoubtedly gained the high level of reliability , especially in terms of political reliability .
This is a huge task , but I am sure that you will be able to do so .
They are not the only one waiting for clarification on this matter .
We followed with great concern the reports of the imprisonment of many Tibetan students and teachers who peacefully expressed their opposition to the government &apos;s plan for reforming the education introduced .
Given the position of the protagonists involved in this process , we will have to demonstrate a certain degree of flexibility .
However , there are also other important factors which could help to facilitate patients &apos; access to cross-border healthcare services in the future .
He will also be called on to establish a Vice-President from the north and open up new prospects on the political scene of his country .
Another important aspect is also the development of alternative sources of funding .
It was a great pleasure for me to work on this report and I hope that they will follow more , one for every country in the Western Balkans .
I therefore support this resolution , which calls on the Commission to include bee diseases as part of the European veterinary policy and to establish an action plan to combat bee mortality .
However , beneficiaries are people who will actually receive this handout .
What remains when the five years have passed ?
I am sorry , but your speaking time is 30 seconds , and the question concerns human rights in Cuba .
Despite the first measures taken by President Yanukovych and the subsequent statements made by the Ukrainian authorities on Ukraine &apos;s will to join the European Union , adopting models of European good governance and respect for human rights and civil liberties of the population , some caution is unavoidably necessary .
Only through a unified European approach can we reduce the problem of the growing quantity of counterfeit products available to the public , not only through traditional selling points , but also through distribution services such as Internet sales .
That is all .
Simplification of access to the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund is an essential part of the support for Member States most affected by the economic crisis that we are experiencing .
( PL ) Mr President , the European Parliament has several times adopted resolutions condemning cases of breaches of human rights and freedoms in various parts of the world .
As you know , the diplomatic consequences of the conflict in Gaza on the surrounding region have been very significant : indirect talks between Syria and Israel have been suspended ; Mauritania and Qatar have suspended contacts with Israel ; a withdrawal of the Arab peace initiative has been threatened .
Firstly , we are talking about a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights , which is not a European institution , but a court itself , even though it is one of the enemies - so to speak - of the European Union , which respects the rule of law , representative democracy and human rights .
We can help open the markets to new technologies , such as clean and energy-efficient vehicles , and facilitate and harmonise standards so that they can be introduced on the market on a massive scale .
However , we do not resign ourselves to this thought and we try to prevent this from happening , even if the reality of the situation requires us to use force for peace missions as well .
This causes serious problems both to hauliers and to EU companies .
Neither is the constant threat to Israeli children .
The new President of the European Council will be in full possession of his duties from 1 January 2010 onwards and has already presented his ideas regarding the future organisation of the Council .
We still do not have a legislative initiative on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon , but the Commission has promised a response to our expectations .
This instrument will facilitate economic , technical , academic , financial and cultural cooperation , which will therefore bring benefits both for the European Union and for its partners .
Climate change , as I have said many times before , is an urgent and serious issue and must be dealt with using specific and effective instruments .
The European Union must move forward and focus on the initiatives needed to be dynamic and competitive economies , establish a robust global trade system and , in the coming weeks , towards an effective climate change agreement .
At that time , anyone who would have thought that the idea of a united Europe in peace , of a European Parliament , was pure fantasy .
Some aspects of the resolution adopted are , however , unclear , while others have not been developed enough .
However , I would like to point out to the next College of Commissioners , both President and Member States , that I and the other Members will continue to do so until the end of the day , because we need to persuade and force our producers to meet high standards .
However , the problem is another : without clarification of the political nature of the European project , we will be unable to tackle our problems .
I agree with the proposal to link the debate on territorial cohesion to the debate on the future of EU cohesion policy , given that the reform of the European Union must take account of the conclusions of the former .
If our Member States , which are concerned about budget restrictions , can invest less in education , training , research and innovation , we are investing at European level by pooling our resources and thus achieving economies of scale .
I call on my fellow Members to develop an oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution : that is , not only to expressly condemn this situation , but also to call on the Azerbaijani Government to return to its decision and renew the FM licences for these radio stations .
Let me reiterate that the political commitment of the Euro Plus Pact should be added to all the other measures contained in the package aimed at improving the economic performance of the Member States : the Stability and Growth Pact on reinforced fiscal supervision , new macro-economic supervision and the implementation of the essential Europe 2020 strategy , with a view to triggering economic growth .
I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the creation of a safe and transparent environment for the functioning and financing of European political parties improves the quality of European democracy .
Alzheimer &apos;s disease is a dangerous disease for which there is no effective medicine , despite numerous research .
We believe that the review conference can only succeed by adopting a balanced strategy .
I fully supported the adoption of the report which supports the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen area .
This is not our task , as I said , and I appeal to your sense of fairness , which normally always shows , and I remain balanced in this time as well .
Before the vote on paragraph 16 :
This has also happened in Baumten , in Austria .
If they are organised properly , they can really make a change .
I would like to highlight two things .
I voted in favour of the report on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security because it makes important proposals such as the common agricultural policy to be introduced after 2013 to respond to the challenges posed by food security , climate change , the economic crisis and the maintenance of territorial balance in the Union .
Following the amendment to the Staff Regulations and the amendment to the Financial Regulation , which is intended to cover the creation of the European External Action Service , it is now necessary to adopt a budget to enable the service to function properly .
( EL ) Mr President , the decision of the new President of the United States of America to close the prison in Guantánamo was one of his first important and positive actions , and I very much welcome it .
I myself introduced a review clause in time to improve the process .
This behaviour , which includes the drawing of Slovenian monuments , walls of Slovenian schools and street signals that the people of Slovenia have been seriously injured by the sentiments of Italian citizens of Slovenian origin and citizens of Slovenia .
This leads to the definitive abandonment of Germany and France &apos;s plans to standardise taxation in the EU .
VAT only goes against the subject C which makes it possible to sell final products to the consumer .
Finally , I would like to mention the dramatic security situation in Darfur and the government &apos;s willingness to hold a referendum on the status of the region on 1 July 2011 .
Such a system takes much greater account of variations and differences of thought between Member States .
Mrs Rapti , I have allowed you a little bit more time , because a park is always difficult .
Under these circumstances , if we are prepared to take measures to defend the democratic values of the European Union , then we must express a solate warning and , Commissioner , apply European law , as you said , along with the thousands of intellectuals , authors and Italian journalists , that freedom to inform and to be fully respected in Italy as a whole , as well as throughout the European Union .
Therefore , with the impetus of this long procedure , they have tried to remove any possible initiatives aimed at controlling the safety measures for ships or at possessing them from the point of view of their own destinations .
The Swedish Presidency has tackled the economic crisis and turbulence of the financial sector by introducing concrete and realistic measures .
Finally , I believe that it is essential to guarantee the right to resume the same work or to have an equivalent working position .
The Commission has a position to follow on these issues .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is fully convinced and consistently supports accession to the European Union for all the countries of the Western Balkans .
However , our efforts are concentrated on the Member States , neglecting what is behind a certain type of market activity .
The leadership of the Environment Council in negotiating and planning policies to combat climate change will have to increase its external capacity .
I hope that the transposition of this legislation by Member States , and especially Italy , will be very swift .
If you wish to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure , you will have the floor at the end of the debate .
It is necessary for data transferred only to be used within a strictly defined framework and not to be transferred to a third country .
The next item is the report by Sajjad Karim , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
The conclusions of the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation , which reaffirms the need to take account of the interests of the outermost regions , seem to me to be an important contribution , since they suggest that Parliament should approve the agreements , provided that the Commission and the Council present as soon as possible an impact assessment on the consequences of these agreements on banana-producing countries and on the outermost regions , and that specific measures are implemented to strengthen the position of trade in favour of ACP producers , along with a programme of bananas .
The key factor in achieving this is the will of developed countries to open up their markets to developing countries , including India .
I very much welcome the fact that Mr David and the other Members have succeeded in drawing up a supported package in committee .
The 2020 target must be to reduce the unemployment rate among young people .
The different speeds of development and increasing inequality in the distribution of opportunities and resources , both on a geographical and social basis and on a generational basis , the increase in the growth of the population of certain areas of the planet , resulting in increased natural disasters , the growth of environmental pollution , the imbalance of antropal pressure concentrated in large urban areas , and the imbalance of demographic growth in certain areas of global solidarity , leading to the growth of minimum areas of solidarity , leading to the rise in which there is an increase in the need for the survival of basic causes of solidarity .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking all my fellow Members for the work that we have done together on this subject and which has allowed all the groups represented in Parliament to agree on a common position , to submit an oral question and to draw up a accompanying resolution on the voluntary partnership agreements .
The European Economic Recovery Plan proposed by the Commission in November 2008 , and subsequently approved by the Council , relates to the resolution of the most urgent problems and calls for a number of investments that should bring benefits to the whole Union in the long term .
Quality of work is very important for people &apos;s dignity , as well as for their income capacities .
Mr President , you mentioned the victims of the attacks in Russia .
It is right to condemn these terrible killings perpetrated by fanatics .
The Commission recently announced 12 actions to stimulate the Single Market by 2012 , including , among other things , measures for financing SMEs and worker mobility .
Schools on sexual and reproductive rights are crucial to the prevention of HIV / AIDS .
Ukraine must take the lead on both sides , regardless of how difficult it seems at this time .
It is extremely important to raise awareness of prescription-only medicines in order to avoid over-consumption of medicines for commercial reasons .
Ukraine is a European state and shares all cultural values .
For us , this law is in conflict with the European values enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
A common legal framework is absolutely essential for facilitating and speeding up the development of these infrastructures .
The President answered my question by saying that these are internal issues in which the European Union cannot interfere .
The European Union must take a stronger position on this matter .
The fact that there is a deficit is a matter that concerns the fund and its members , not the taxpayer .
The Venice Commission expressed its negative view because the premiums of this kind are only given in Denmark , Sweden and Slovenia , where , as we know , the fight between producers is not taking place .
I will refer to a statement by Mrs Doyle .
However , all this requires conviction , time and , above all , political courage , which is lacking .
In the Commission &apos;s proposal about a decade ago , however , it became an optional measure : instead of creating a single market aspect , the Commission is destroying it .
For these two reasons , I think that we should be very careful not so much to where the money comes from , but to where it comes from .
First of all , we have to acknowledge to Vice-President Tajani that he has given a very strong impetus to the new European tourism policy provided for in the competences of the Treaty of Lisbon , with the communication from June last year and with the relevant implementation plan presented a few weeks ago .
I am also in favour of greater budgetary support - general or specific to individual sectors - and of a smaller number of projects , whenever macroeconomic and governance criteria allow for this .
Finally , I would like to mention that , just two hundred years ago , Darwin published his book on the origin of the species .
I think that , thanks to the perseverance of the Swedish Presidency , we will be able to succeed at the Copenhagen conference .
However , I believe that the measures that have already been taken for the marking of sheep are generally positive .
Mrs Lulling , I have just been informed that the debate on rosé wine is scheduled for May .
( RO ) Madam President , as has already been said in previous speeches , the European Union has clearly not made sufficient progress so far to ensure financial stability in its markets .
In the end , we will not be the last bulwark of this missile defence system .
I would like to start by providing you with some important information about the 2009 edition of the Sakharov Prize .
The main objective of the Commission competition policy is to allow the companies concerned to benefit from a security area through the adoption of block exemption regulations , with the aim of ensuring effective market surveillance .
Madam President , the spring summit should be the energy summit .
Citizens expect the laws to be the same for everyone .
I agree with the rapporteur that these upgrades to the EU-Egypt Free Trade Agreements can contribute to economic and political stability in this key region , with the aim of consolidating a single area of peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
This report seeks to make its contribution to a new energy action plan within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy .
- Regarding Mrs Ţicău &apos;s question ?
Europe must make more efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals ; in other words , it must devote at least 0.7 % of its GDP to the fight against poverty in developing countries by 2015 .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that both reports emphasise the principle of partnership .
It is a clear contradiction to the Copenhagen criteria , to another type of legislation , and , at the same time , where there is no interest or perhaps courage , to hide behind the lack of jurisdiction so that we do not have to make progress , if I may say so , in the protection of minorities , but the dilemma that we are ultimately faced with is detrimental .
Many of these irregularities are detected and / or communicated later , which jeopardises the proper protection and proper use of taxpayers &apos; money .
I congratulate the Swedish Presidency of the EU and the Commission on having activated the Community Civil Protection Mechanism .
I would like to appeal to the European Commission to adopt the necessary measures to intensify monitoring , which is an essential part of EU policy for the protection of consumer security .
Free Padania !
We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the draft EU budget for 2011 .
Farmers have no contact with the end consumer , and they are treating intermediaries who always have the opportunity to choose for imports .
The best thing is not true of this world , but I personally welcome these two nominations which have struck a balance between everyone &apos;s interests , namely between the small and large countries , between men and women , and between different political parties .
Mr President , today &apos;s terrorism is widely identified with Islamic terrorism .
All the parties involved can and must learn lessons from this in order to prevent such cases from happening again in the future .
( PL ) Madam President , we all know that diamonds can be a blessing , but also a curse .
This European Parliament resolution therefore focuses , in particular , on job creation and the fight against social isolation .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that one thing that we all agree with is that , through this programme of harmonisation of frequencies and coordinated use of the spectrum , we can assert a two-fold task .
The reason for this is that there are still wars on the planet , and there are currently 4 million refugees and displaced Iraqi people , and it is clear that these refugees are the consequences of wars , including those of our countries .
Can you now , Madam President , address an official invitation to the Czech Presidency and the future Swedish Presidency to open a formal dialogue with the European Parliament as soon as possible ?
Faced with this situation , Europe &apos;s voice must be high in calling on us to honour the commitments made in the context of official development assistance ; to call for new sources of additional resources to help these countries ; to demand a reduction in the burden and duties that weigh up the burden of migrants ; and to oppose attempts at protectionist response ; and to support a round of negotiations focused on development in the context of the Doha Return ; and to call for a moratorium on tax evasion ; and on taxation ;
There are those who say that trademarks are expensive , but many products already have a brand mark , so the additional costs should be minimal .
There is nothing to indicate that the restrictions stipulated in the document influence or restrict the Member States in issuing passports in some way .
I fully agree with the rapporteur .
I would like to thank the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality and Parliament as a whole for all the work they have done to achieve this .
Foreign operators must not pay to use our roads , but in the UK , there is a tax on petrol of as many as 23 per litre , which gives competitors an advantage of 15 % .
As a result , the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to set up a general headquarters could serve this purpose , supplying the current command structures of NATO in the field of joint military and civil operations .
However , we must not forget the jobs involved in the decision we are debating today .
The new rules adopted today by Parliament will give a real impetus to consumer rights throughout Europe .
The human rights movement has been proposed from the outset as a movement to overcome Stalinism in the country &apos;s public , political and cultural life .
At the same time , I would like to emphasise our full responsibility with regard to taxpayers &apos; money .
Only yesterday , we attended a meeting with the Commission in Madrid , which Commissioner Reding was also present .
If we succeed in doing this , we will help at least extend the decent work programme .
I and my group - the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left - are deeply concerned about the weakness of the content and how it has been drafted .
The Financial Regulation guarantees a sound system of control and brings the Service closer to the Commission .
I offered myself voluntarily to replace it in this important debate .
One extremely important source of potential for the Baltic and Central European States would be the use of emissions ratings generated under the Kyoto Protocol , which would benefit the climate resources of these countries .
Thank you .
I voted in favour of the rapporteur &apos;s proposals and the approach taken by the Commission in the communication entitled &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; , as well as the conviction that an annual Single Market Forum should be established .
Like my fellow Members , I regret that the Council is opposed to Parliament &apos;s new power of codecision on long-term management plans .
I voted in favour of this report .
- Report : Paolo Costa
on behalf of the ADLE Group . - ( DA ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to express my partial disappointment that after four years , we still do not have a Commission proposal on how to tighten up animal transport legislation .
This report is the result of a compromise , since 1625 amendments have been tabled on the same basis and are divided into a number of key points that take the root causes of the crisis from the property bubbles to banking products without guarantees , leading to a lack of European fiscal harmonisation and a lack of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact .
Despite this difficult situation , such measures will allow a regular flow of money to be retained to guarantee payments to beneficiaries when programmes are implemented .
I firmly believe that Member States &apos; tax authorities must cooperate in order to discover tax fraud .
Shahbaz Bhatti , a minister of the Pakistani Government , Salman Taseer , Governor of the Province of Punjab , or Sabir Jamaldini , coordinator of the Pakistani Human Rights Committee , have become innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law .
Let me explain : I would like to use a language that also reflects the positive nature of the European Union , because , although it may seem surprising , there have also been positive aspects in recent times .
This is an important measure in support of families with children , enabling them to reduce the tax burden they are subject to .
We must welcome them with enthusiasm and not with mix attitudes .
in writing . - ( LV ) Over recent days , European farmers are experiencing difficulties , which we all need to overcome together , in order to help develop the livestock sector and generate a sufficient income for farmers .
It seems to me that we are trying to confuse waters here , so that the control exercised by the European Union diminishes the principles we should respect .
Now changes to the Treaty that should have lasted a generation , with a simplified process , as the EU &apos;s Presidents have requested , to create a mechanism which considers to be &apos; fully compatible with the policies &#91; the International Monetary Fund ) &apos; .
Autonomous work is of paramount importance to women , because it can be of great help to avoid unemployment or to better reconcile professional life and family life .
It is crucial that the European Union make concrete action and that it becomes a global pioneer in the reduction of carbon emissions ahead of the Copenhagen Summit .
It is also important to allow women to participate in post-conflict reconstruction in their countries .
In this way , candidates from all the members of the IMF will be able to participate on the basis of their merits , taking all the relevant aspects into account .
Without this help , the country would not be able to fully integrate into many sectors of the economy and to achieve the objectives it has set itself .
Above all , thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament , all funds sold in the European Union will actually be subject to similar legislation .
in writing . - ( HU ) Over the course of six months , the European Union has gone down from a situation of hope to a situation with almost total disunion .
The businesses whose products have been certified in one country will not therefore have to repeat the entire certification process in another .
We are all convinced that it is extremely important to work with India in order to complete the negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement that will enable both sides - the EU and India - to benefit .
Resistance of antibiotics ( debate )
Mr Takkula &apos;s report raises a major social problem .
Many recent events have shown how important it is that consumer confidence is , and this is partly the result of national laws that deal with consumer protection in the market .
Baroness Ashton , are you in a position to confirm what you said and to analyse the situation ?
The Muslim Brotherhood promotes this programme openly and enjoys 20 % of the election preferences .
Of course , we have the EU 2020 strategy , where sustainability is a planned objective .
( The sitting was suspended at 13.45 and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that what has happened to the Committee of the Regions is a serious and damaging fact of the rights of a Member State of the European Union .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my surprise at the speeches by my fellow Members who speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises , on the other hand , when they are taking the first step in the middle of the microentities - because that is what we are talking about today , not for others - are inclined to withdraw again .
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to encourage good management of these waste , thereby limiting its hazard , and the establishment of a more demanding regulators capable of preventing any infringement of the directive .
Our objective should be the full passage to renewable energy by 2050 .
In my opinion , we do not need additional rules ; what we need is a completely correct application of the existing rules , and I think that your remarks on navigation systems and other devices are useful for this debate .
Part more complains about the population ageing in Europe .
I think , therefore , that it is up to Parliament to us to aim for more dynamic decisions in order to respond to the problems that exist in Europe , without forgetting transparency in the management of funds .
It is totally absurd and totally unacceptable that Members of Parliament , in secret , should ask the Commission to provide information on the content of the agreements on which we are then called upon to vote .
I would also like to emphasise the positive interaction between public and private actions which encourages the compensation of victims and defines a term of prescription for five years .
I join the rapporteur in welcoming the efforts made in strengthening the management of financial resources and human resources , as well as the improvements in functionality and efficiency of the internal control functions achieved in 2008 .
Normally , Russia &apos;s sincerity is incomprehensible by its commitment to resolving conflicts such as this , but the fact is that Russia cannot interfere in Transnistria as in Georgia and Ukraine .
I would like to express my satisfaction at the adoption of Mrs Jáuregui &apos;s report on the EU &apos;s accession to the Convention on Human Rights .
in writing . - Parliament voted today on the amendment of the legal basis of the regulation on radioactive contamination of foodstuffs .
I therefore agree that it is necessary to call on Member States to take measures to improve the situation of children left by their parents in their country of origin and to ensure their normal development in education and social terms .
The Campania region and , in general , the Italian state are creating a waste disposal network under EU law .
Above all , it will make the market safer and more competitive .
I call for very strong action from the President of Parliament to obtain an answer on this aggression .
In the Europe of dreams , freedom of expression is a fundamental value .
( DE ) Mr President , there are real problems in all countries with a crisis .
We call on the Council not to ridicule this House or to do so .
I and my group are therefore in favour of this directive , which is an essential initiative by Parliament and will have a positive effect on the lives of European citizens .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive tabled by the Commission on consumer rights has the merit of bringing together the previous four directives on the subject in a single legislative instrument .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , particularly Mr Sánchez Presedo of the Socialists and Mrs Bowles , for the excellent work they have done on this compromise text presented today as a report on the Commission White Paper .
( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , we can see how interested the authors of the question are in the fact that none of them are in the Chamber any more , so he has not heard what Mrs Vaidere said just now - that Russia visa policy was actually a weapon used not to promote birth , but in order to achieve exactly the opposite .
However , I believe that the work we have done enables us to be optimistic .
In my opinion , the European Union should seriously consider this possibility during the next dialogue with the mediation of the High Representative .
( DE ) Mr President , the debate reflects the unresolved issues of economic policy in Europe .
In addition , the Commission &apos;s research control strategy has been explored to provide a reasonable level of legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis throughout the framework programme .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
It is trying to manipulate the European Union &apos;s trade policy , to which the United Kingdom is , unfortunately , bound at the moment , in order to implement a strong socialist agenda , which has always been rejected .
It is important to make it clear that illegal work will no longer be tolerated .
Media broadcasting is one of the most important sources of information that citizens have in the Member States of the European Union and , as such , is an important factor in forming the values and opinions of people .
No one could understand that .
If some do not want to return home , they can request political asylum from their own prisons .
If this is not a result of state-of-the-art homophobia and the criminalisation of the right of homosexuals to express themselves freely in public , then tell me what it is about .
It is not just individual entrepreneurs who will benefit from this , as the European market itself will become more competitive than the large economies of countries such as the United States , China or Japan .
It is impossible to exclude , or anticipate , all the events that can take place in the aviation sector .
There is a certain improvement in this area , too .
In this way , the Presidency follows on from the conclusions of the March 2010 European Council , which stressed the need to reduce the school dropout rate in Europe , and which also set the major collective target of bringing it below 10 % by 2020 .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thousands of children are victims of traffickers every year or , more often , are abducted .
Sana management and EU regional policy (
It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability , for example .
This kind of cooperation greatly simplifies the life of the rapporteur .
It is therefore very important , from a political point of view , to vote in favour of this text and this volteface by Mrs Wallis - and part of this House - that is not absolutely justifiable , given the previous debates that we had .
In addition , this position is also supported by the study drafted for the Commission by the Swiss institutions of comparative law and by the Schaldemose report of 2009 adopted by Parliament .
( NL ) I should like to start by thanking Mr Bowis for his strong , unworthy commitment to public health and patient mobility , and I wish him a speedy recovery .
The problems that have arisen in the European aviation sector in recent years have still demonstrated the fundamental role of transport of goods and passengers in the structure of society .
Secondly - and above all - we did this in that way because you are exploiting the attention that the victims normally have to pay to in order to create a new paperwork for immigration : social assistance and legal aid , automatic residence permits , access to the labour market , simplified access to family reunification and social security .
In a message addressed to many governments , they have declared themselves against certain policies , such as those aimed at reducing tax pressure .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the package on which we will vote tomorrow would have ended up in nothing without the will of the European Parliament , and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the work that we have done .
Unfortunately , however , GDP is no longer a reliable basis for political debate because it fails to measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion itself .
I think that should be a matter for the G20 .
The next item is the Commission statement on the efficiency of European agencies in relation to employment , working conditions and training .
The reality is that the noble cause of human rights has too often been degraded by milionist lawyers who enriched themselves by defending the unlawful rights of terrorists , criminals and blackmail .
The European Parliament is today calling for the immediate release of Dawit Isaak and other journalists who are in prison in Eritrea .
Let me take this opportunity , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , to thank you for the additional EUR 10 million that Parliament adopted at the end of 2008 in favour of the European Refugee Fund .
Nowadays , patients are increasingly looking for health information so that they can be actively involved in their own health decisions .
They are disillusioned and discouraged by the possibility of being cut off from the labour market .
Unless paragraph 1 is achieved , it is pointless and paragraph 1 , which calls for a strong and sustainable CAP with a budget commensurate with ambitious objectives , will also be pointless .
the report by Mr Grech , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on the creation of a Single Market for consumers and citizens ,
It is also necessary to establish realistic parameters for increasing employment , especially among young people .
What is positive is that we are all interested in research and we know that this is the only hope for Europe and the Member States .
In my opinion , the Presidency was wrong not to explicitly condemn this article .
Measures are needed to regulate late payment in commercial transactions in order to protect the health of the European economy and to prevent situations of financial asphypes of production structures and excessive recourse to financial products that increase their dependence on the banking sector .
It is absurd to encourage the importation of products which do not even meet the quality criteria that our farmers are obliged to meet .
To conclude , we must face up to major challenges to ensure unity at European level , adopt strategic commitments with important external partners and maintain our commitment to multilateral climate action .
Our initiatives must therefore move towards concrete problems , put forward strong issues and focus on specific measures that will bring added value to citizens &apos; everyday lives .
Oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
Opening of the session
Once again , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive attitude .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s amendment that moves towards the protection of bees , which are indispensable for farmers and for the food supply , with their pollination .
In this way , we can encourage users to prefer vehicles or cleaner modes of transport to use less congested infrastructures or to travel to different hours .
In the area of security , we are concerned about Iran &apos;s attitude and the worsening situation in Afghanistan .
I think it is important that we come to the negotiating table as it is clear that , in this case , the best solution must involve everyone in a joint effort .
We must know which Member States offer high standards and which they are on a low level .
On the other hand , the remaining countries have decided , for reasons which seem to reflect the particular interests of each other towards the two candidates , that Romania and Bulgaria are still not part of the area to try and delay their accession again .
I am pleased that it has been possible to reach agreement on this text so that the slots of flights can be frozen in the summer season .
Therefore , we must analyse , for example , what happened in Detroit to try and avoid errors , but we must not respond with a reflection following any attack , because that would probably result in the adoption of measures which , in some cases , would not make sense simply .
At least , all the care provided for in full time must be recognised for the purposes of the pension pension period .
Other unfounded and unfounded political attacks will be superfluous .
In this respect , the European approach could be &apos; Yes &apos; , of course we cannot do without external supply and we need security of supply and large-scale innovative projects such as Desertec , but we must also ensure that people , large organisations and businesses , as well as individual households , can have greater control over their energy budgets and their energy consumption in terms of price , economy and the environment &apos; .
For these reasons , the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the proposals which require an impact assessment and will vote in favour of the amendments proposed by Mr Sturdy - which I subscribed - on endocrats and those aimed at authorising the use of plant protection products in emergency cases .
It is scandalous that some of the laborious countries - always the same - are constantly being called upon to pay the debts of others .
Europe has been heavily engaged in the region for a long time : EUR 1 billion per year in Afghanistan , 300 million in Pakistan , the EUPOL mission , which is doing some valuable work beyond its personal problems , the international observation mission , and then , of course , the commitment of individual states to the ISAF mission .
That is a point .
Moreover , India must elaberi and implement certain transparent and clear rules on public procurement , which will also allow European companies to participate in the crackdown .
As a result , thanks to appropriate impact assessment and the identification of the various legal options , along with a clear definition of the objectives and funding of European infrastructure , long-term strategic projects for strengthening the European Union will be easier to achieve .
The ratification of the new START treaty , which is still pending in US Congress , is part of this process .
It is increasingly mobile and recent analyses suggest that organised crime is increasingly involved in cyberspace activities .
I also think that , as has already been said , we have highlighted the questionable issues , particularly in group supervision .
It is my firm intention to work in tandem with this President of the European Council , because this partnership will be decisive .
On the other hand , the positive part is the one that provides for the creation of a separate immigration network both between the consular authorities and international organisations , with the task of preventing illegal immigration and facilitating the return of illegal immigrants .
At this point , it can be said in full that the Brandenburg bear became the door of freedom .
First of all , the communication explains how good tax governance can be achieved within the European Union and thus encourages other jurisdictions to follow the same example .
At the beginning of my speech , I spoke of the choice in no uncertain terms , and the Commission knows what path it wants to take .
However , it is clear that if the two main parties in the country persist in their obstinacy , this will never be achieved .
In my opinion , your contribution is all the more crucial , because the current situation is forcing Member States to make difficult choices , but , on the contrary , it is necessary to protect research and development as an investment for the future , and I can assure you that I can assure you that I will inform the Council about the content of this debate , always remaining available to you .
We should have the humility of recognising the right to democracy and parliamentary sovereignty of all 27 Member States .
I also believe that a zero tolerance policy must be applied in the area of human rights and democratisation , and we must expect a very high standard .
( RO ) Mr President , this regulation represents a step forward towards the gradual fulfilment of CO2 emissions for light commercial vehicles in Europe .
It is clear that the transport strategy lies at the heart of major strategic developments in Europe .
Specifically , the groups most threatened by these unethical practices , such as children , young people and the elderly , must be protected .
Irrespective of this , I very much welcome the work of micro-credit in Poland .
It is up to the Egyptian authorities to take urgent measures to put an end to torture , investigate all cases of abuse of peaceful demonstrators and put an end to civilian trials before military courts .
There are even cases of coexistence of different national systems within a country .
The answer , therefore , is to ensure greater democracy , not to have a policy of extreme right , hostility and cynical contempt for people .
It is naive to put our hopes back on an EU-wide database , with inevitable linguistic differences and IT systems , when in the UK , the attempt to create such a database for the National Health Service failed despite the investment of several billion euros .
In October 2010 , the Commission adopted a communication entitled &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; , which aimed at relaunching the Single Market .
Also , in the name of legal certainty and predictability , the European Union has a duty to draw up an effective , transparent and accessible mechanism for resolving small and medium-sized enterprises ( for example , small enterprises ) .
This proposal for an EU tax is unconstitutional !
We need a plan B , as has rightly been said , and the railway system is the alternative .
I would like to express our gratitude to the European Parliament for the additional amount of EUR 3 million allocated in the 2008 EU budget for the recovery of cultural heritage in the areas affected by the war in the Western Balkans .
In addition , Member States must ensure that repatriation operations do not take place in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which obliges the Member States to ensure that a person is not returned to his country if exposed to the risk of persecution or serious attacks following his repatriation .
In this way , your action will be more effective than the solution for derogations and the functional separation of the various funds .
European legislation must pay particular attention to the extreme vulnerability of women and children who are victims of domestic violence .
I hope that now that all 26 elected assemblies have given a positive opinion , administrative decision makers will not slow down the democratic process by denying their signature .
2010 progress report on Iceland
There are also significant differences with regard to the conviction rate for cases of violence against women in individual Member States .
Membership of Parliament : see Minutes
In my opinion , the key issue is raising citizens &apos; awareness , and I believe that the reports will help achieve this .
The next item is the vote .
It is important to bear in mind that we are in a period of transition from an intergovernmental approach to a Community approach , and I am very pleased about that for the area of justice and social affairs .
It should not be forgotten , however , that the good of the child comes before everything else .
However , these obligations should not be abolished , but instead of excluding microentities from the fourth directive , we need to establish a reduced requirement for the regulation , setting it within the framework of the review planned for the fourth and seventh directives .
When armed conflicts reach a dimension so that not even the international institutions are safer , the situation becomes extremely serious .
This report contains the following proposals , in my opinion , which are important : improving the collection of information at local and regional level ; improving the information of patients ; increasing specialist injuries in the control of infections ; promoting education and training of health professionals ; and increasing attention to hospital infections .
Now Ireland has decided to hold a second referendum .
I welcome the initiative by the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , calling on the European Union to officially recognise the genocide committed by the Nazis and their allies against the Roma population during the Second World War , as it represents a step forward in the fight to defend the rights of the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , this is not the first time that our colleague , Mr Cohn-Bendit , who has called a President - a Prime Minister - a dictator to the way in which Hugo Chavez , has not respected democracy .
The Tobin tax is a model of a tax on proposed financial transactions .
There are countless Roma who , throughout Europe , continue to pay in extreme poverty and face acts of discrimination and marginalisation , so it is time to take action .
It is the duty of society to ensure that this freedom of choice is guaranteed by preventing discrimination against a given activity for the simple reason that it does not form part of a regular , formal conception of the labour market .
In my 30 years of professional experience in the accounting sector and the review of the accounts , I have never seen a body auditing the auditor on how to do his job .
Parliament should look more closely at the implementation and transposition of the laws that we encompass here .
I am thinking about the abolition of duties on textile products coming from Pakistan , which would cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Lombardy and the rest of Europe .
Membership of committees : see Minutes
The major changes in Europe &apos;s rural areas represent a demographic challenge , employment , environmental and services .
It is therefore vital to strengthen and develop strong , concrete cooperation while , at the same time , adapting it to the new challenges in international relations .
From Copenhagen , I expect short- and medium-term commitments and the possibility of verifying compliance with them , with sanctions if they do not comply with them .
The delegation of Vrijidsisterij ( PVV ) therefore voted against this proposal and wants the costs of all losses to be borne by stakeholders .
I have these questions because , although I welcome the solidarity measures taken on 11 February , I seriously doubt that we Europeans are really up to this situation .
It will be said that once Europe was divided , that there was in the midst of a great wall , and that people in the East were very poor and did not have democracy , and were not living under a crippled communism , which killed millions of its citizens .
I would remind you that the Polish Parliament approved the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in April this year , but that the ratification documents have yet to be signed by the President .
I agree with your assessment of the Commission &apos;s proposal and would like to make a few comments on the importance of these activities .
The next item is the joint debate on :
It is now important that the negotiations are started and that Parliament be ready for this .
We believe that the accusations made against these European citizens are unfounded and I can assure you that we will remain in constant contact with the Iranian authorities in order to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion , namely the release of European citizens .
The Movement for a Better Hungary would like to put an end to the economic monopoly of multinationals and restore Europe to small farmers and family firms so that unemployment can be eliminated in the European Union with their help .
In conjunction with the recommendations of the Committee on Civil Liberties , I voted against the proposal for a decision .
These are the following challenges : firstly , to move on to a common immigration policy ; secondly , to improve the organisation of legal immigration ; thirdly , to improve integration procedures ; fourthly , to combat illegal or illegal immigration with the utmost determination ; fifth , to develop Frontex ; thirdly , to improve procedures , conventions and agreements with countries of origin and transit ; or , to continue a common asylum policy ; and ,
The Irish &apos; yes &apos; means that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force ; we know that , because that was the last obstacle .
The priority is given to employment , given that recovery is in danger of implementing without reducing unemployment .
The European Union must serve as a model , both for the consolidation of rules and for the efforts to solidarity .
Between 14 June and 14 October 2010 , 1 336 redundancies took place , while a further 1 498 cases took place sooner or later .
The aim is to conclude this entirely and report on the outcome of the negotiations at the June Council .
in writing . - The financial crisis of 2008 clearly highlighted the need for a European supervisory authority to coordinate the regulation and supervision of the financial sector in the EU .
For example , let us remember the research projects financed under the Seventh Framework Programme , especially those involving the Israeli aircraft industry , which led to the production of telecoms aircraft used in the attacks on the Gaza Strip that took place in 2008 and 2009 , in which there were dozens of victims .
( LT ) Thank you , Minister , for your efforts as a country holding the Presidency in the fight against poverty .
I , too , believe that without a global agreement , all our efforts will be invaded .
I would like to highlight a paragraph of the draft Commission statement annexed to the proposal .
These three reports maintain the spirit and the broad thrust of the new strategy for the Single Market of Mario Monti and can represent the sole objective of relaunching the European Single Market through 50 measures , which are then reproduced and summarised , or emphasised , by this Parliament with 14 priorities .
The governments of the Gulf have responded differently , providing a financial envelope to alleviate the most pressing social needs , announcing political reforms , handing certain legislative powers to elected bodies or declaring them open to more generalised and inclusive national dialogue .
As regards Mr Ziobro &apos;s argument , there is no risk that the Strasbourg Court will interfere with the competences of the European Union .
I will come back to all these issues at the negotiating table for the reform of the POSEI programme .
in writing . - I join the admiration expressed during the debate for the courage of the Tunisian and Egyptian people to express their disappointment and disappointment about their regimes .
I therefore do not understand why we cannot adopt the same kind of agenda from this perspective .
The European Union has introduced legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to employees affected by the consequences of major structural changes in global trade patterns and to help them re-enter the labour market .
The wide nature of the final text and the guarantees that guarantee consumer rights are a salute to its negotiating skills .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the proposal to establish the obligation for EU Member States to report annually to the Commission on the activities of their export credit agencies with regard to the calculation of risks and the publication of off-budgetary instruments and to make the notification of the calculation of their social and environmental risks obligatory .
Mr Ronzulli , please sit down and be silent .
This is an important fact , which shows Parliament &apos;s determination and ability to stand a central role in the CFSP / CSDP area on the basis of a reading , I would like to say , dynamically , the Lisbon Treaty .
Overall , therefore , I support this report , provided that Member States play a leading role in managing , identifying and protecting wilderness areas .
Above all , after what has been a long journey for many months , I take the wishes of this House to see a service that reflects the needs of the constituencies that you represent , a service that serves them adequately .
The item is closed .
This and other issues could have been addressed at the summit .
Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity must not be called into question .
As you see , therefore , we are very close to the same level .
That is why this debate is important : to remember that this year , in 2009 , the Commission made a commitment to present to Parliament a communication on assessing possible threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information , and to draw attention to the importance of developing a directive that guarantees pluralism of information in the field of new technologies and , in particular , on television .
The effective application of the directive and the compensation of failures highlighted in the transposition and application of previous directives will complement the defence against discrimination provided to EU citizens .
I welcome the adoption of this report , which stresses the importance of European political parties as essential players in the political life of the EU , and promotes concrete proposals with the aim of creating a secure and transparent legal environment for the functioning and financing of European political parties .
Therefore , if we are to achieve the objectives we are setting ourselves here every week , we need an ambitious budget , which means no less money in the future but more resources .
Yanukovych won the democratic presidential elections , although with a narrow margin .
At a time when the impact of the recession is being felt considerably and the sovereign debt crisis , we need strong economic governance at EU level .
The joint debate is closed .
The rapporteur believes that all the conditions required for the abolition of border controls with Bulgaria and Romania have been met , but calls for Parliament to be kept aware of the additional measures to be taken at the border between Bulgaria , Greece and Turkey , which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration .
I am pleased to be able to say that the regulation on air passengers &apos; rights has proved to be fundamental in providing a safety net that guarantees that it is not passengers who do not have to bear the burden of the financial consequences of disruption of air traffic and that they are not left to the streets as a result of chaos .
As in 2004 , the Presidency of the Council will have to choose for this important post as a candidate for the leading position of the European Parliament , and on 15 July it will be up to this House to vote on this and thus meet one of the first major commitments of the new parliamentary term .
We must call on all political forces to put an end to this crisis , because the alternative is Albania &apos;s isolation and the risk of undermining its European prospects .
I agree with the resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
I also insist on the need to demand the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba and in the rest of the world , but , nonetheless , I warn against the action that has already been shown to be disastrous for the progress of Cuba towards democracy and liberalisation , such as embargo and blockade .
For the sake of the citizens of Sri Lanka , I would like to see an expression repeatedly repeated - &apos; war &apos; as an institution - finally hand over to the past .
Public opinion is very sensitive and completely contrary to pointless painful practices .
Secondly , if we really want to achieve the 95 % target in 2050 , the roadmap includes a reduction of at least 30 % by 2020 .
The sector concerned and , in particular , the groups of investors have generally recognised the need for this instrument , but over three years since the implementation of MiFID , market operators have failed to reach agreement to create a European system of consolidated buttons .
We must also allow regulatory authorities to ensure that these rights are respected .
Like Commissioner Tajani , I , too , would like to express my warm appreciation and gratitude for the work carried out by Commissioner Barrot , which has been very important , and also for the good will of the French Presidency .
This House is poorer than you have been missing , and the Swedish Presidency has certainly earned us well .
Europe must ensure greater efficiency in energy consumption .
Their aim is to buy goods and services with the best price ratio .
However , we Swedish Social Democrats welcome the fact that you have ultimately accepted our demands and Parliament so that the programme takes greater account of the rights of women and children .
It is clear that changes of different nature are taking place in different Member States .
The opposite of what these organisation would have liked to see happen .
( FR ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s resolution shows that in this area , like many others , our institution has absolutely no powers of judgment with regard to the dogmas that we have .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , President of the European Council , I see two major problems with the proposed amendment of Article 136 , one institutional and one politician .
This is therefore a step in the right direction .
However , I do not agree with the opportunity to link the fight against HIV to a sensitive issue such as abortion .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . - ( LV ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as regards the annual report ( 2007 ) on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy , I would like to highlight some important issues from the perspective of the Committee on Budgets .
Finally , the absence of any reference to undemocratic decisions and to incrimination of citizens , such as the prohibition of Communist parties and other organisations , as well as the detention of Communist representatives and other dissidents in the Member States of the European Union , Central and Baltic Europe , is revealing the true nature of the report .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
Let us abandon free trade policies , stop free movement of capital , let us encourage food sovereignty , let us equip world water and energy and combat socio-economic inequalities .
firstly , that the future of EU agriculture must be guaranteed even after 2013 ;
The question arises as to whether the existing projects that have already been funded by the Cohesion Fund or within the framework of new projects .
That is why we must reiterate our will to stand by these people after President Mubarak &apos;s speech today , after the regime wrote its seats and after the regime paved the way for violence .
I would like to thank the Presidents of Borrell and Pöttering and Parliament &apos;s Committee on Petitions today in support of the campaign calling for justice for Mr Shields .
That is why I voted against this report .
As far as the European Union and Portugal are concerned , establishing a binding target would involve greater profits than losses .
To have the same annual salary as a man , a woman should work , on average , until the end of February , for a total of 418 days .
They have been suffering systematic discrimination and threats of assimilation and death , and their identity is under threat .
This report concerns the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I , too , would like to thank the Commissioner for coming here today to explain better the powers which she asks for .
He ignored the key issue of the reorganisation of the international monetary system .
Human rights must be your number one concern .
Then companies would no longer be tempted to practise illegal activities .
( CS ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , EU visa policy is facing a major challenge : the requirement for visas for Czech citizens for 10 months now .
The EMA plays a vital role as a basic source of objective information .
I received an amendment to today &apos;s vote , following yesterday &apos;s meeting between President Buzek and Prime Minister Zapatero , to begin immediately with a dialogue at the highest institutional level on certain procedural aspects relating to the Council &apos;s discharge .
Subject : Renews
If we were in the ancient Senator , you would raise a senator with his toga senator and , if you say so to Mr Trichet , would you say : &apos; What is the words &apos; what are a fair tandem , Trichete , a brain of ours ? &apos;
Finally , Mr President , if you will allow me , in order to dispel all the suspicions that may arise , I would propose that a European Parliament committee of inquiry into these facts be established .
The service concessions were deliberately punished by the procurement directives to ensure greater flexibility in the areas concerned and to take account of cultural differences .
I share some of the other ideas that have been expressed , but , in my opinion , it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and intelligible .
I believe that this network can be of great use , but it does not work effectively at the moment and does not make the most of its potential .
It is true that EPAs are , of course , very different from the Lomé and Cotonou Conventions , where the EU &apos;s relations with the ACP countries have , for 30 years , been realised , but the unilateral preferences set out in those agreements were the side of the accusations of other developing countries in the World Trade Organisation .
However , while we fully support the integration of Roma into the European Union , we have serious doubts about the EU &apos;s involvement in issues that we consider to be the preserve of individual nation states such as access to healthcare , education , employment and housing .
It is also essential to prioritise food security , agriculture , infrastructure , capacity building and , in particular , economic growth and access to technology , as well as the human and social development of the least developed countries .
We cannot continue in this way .
The ultimate objective is the better application of EU legislation and therefore the most healthy animals and decent living conditions .
What measures will be taken to encourage richer countries to contribute to the costs of the crisis ?
We also need to develop good practice : for example , Slovenia follows vehicles in its own country .
It is also essential that these solutions be beneficial not only to citizens , but also to future generations .
If we are to avoid a stop to fishing , then we must keep the exploitation rate to 30 % .
There are priorities to be dealt with urgently .
Cohesion policy must contribute , not only to reducing productivity gaps due to the crisis , but also to enabling productivity to recover .
This is a very important issue for all European citizens , and the way in which the Commission and Parliament will deal with it will be very revealing about their responsibility and transparency .
Finally , I would like to point out that all the non-conventional measures adopted during the period of great financial pressure are of a temporary nature and were aimed at emerging from the crisis .
I find so many indications of the conduct of this Parliament which are emerging from this report dismayed .
the strict organisation of projects , the effective use of resources and the clarity of their duration ;
At the moment , the situation is very different and therefore , as you say , patients are exposed to risks .
I , too , would like to state from the outset that I support the efforts made by Turkey to promote democratisation .
The Commission &apos;s proposal extends the concept of micro-entities , setting out companies that , on the date of closing the budget , do not exceed the numerical limits of two of the following criteria : the total capital status of EUR 500 000 , a net net turnover of EUR 1 000 and / or average number of employees employed during the financial year of EUR 10 000 .
However , we must all respect our commitment to climate change : everyone recognises that we are leaders in the world in this area .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I take the liberty of feeling that I had not seen the full change in the programme today , but I would like to thank you for the opportunity to address this House and address a very important issue for the financial services sector , namely the reassurance and reassurance sector , the outcome of the report on solvency II and the way in which the European Parliament has been presented , so that the basis for concrete regulation will be established , which I believe will be the basis of the basis of the European Union .
Therefore , it is absolutely crucial to go to 30 % and I will conclude by saying again that Barack Obama said that we could surrender the jobs of the future to our competitors or to seize the opportunity of the century , as they have already begun to do .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to make four comments .
That is why , together with some of my fellow Members , I have called on an expert to speak tomorrow in this House who has conducted an investigation into such trafficking and into cases of medical murder , aimed at trade in organs in China .
President-in-Office of the Council , thank you for your very constructive and comprehensive presentation , and we wish you all the best for your Presidency .
These initiatives , supported by EU funds , provide us with the opportunity to cooperate in practice on specific projects and programmes , which support the forces of each institution and , in this way , are a very good test of influencing the evolution of our joint work .
- ( SK ) Once again , we are faced with a problem concerning respect for the rights of ethnic minorities in Slovakia , a problem raised by the Education Minister , a member of the ruling party , which is extremely nationalist .
You fear that protection should be provided , such as the possibility for a European citizen of administrative redress , with reciprocity of treatment with the Use citizen , and the round of life on the time of storage of information , European and US cooperation is , in this case , the proper distribution of globalisation to its perverse effects .
The EIB can and must play an important role in managing recent Mediterranean events .
I therefore support the call for a deepening of the proportion of margins in the production and distribution chain .
Yet , if you put the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle first and foremost - I am ready to discuss with you - then it is the Member States that cause traffic congestion and do not offer sufficient infrastructure .
The first is credit for the mobility of students .
It is important to understand that , although these events mainly affect the southern border of Europe , they give us the opportunity to strengthen the link between citizens and what Europe is about : added value in terms of response .
Today , Europe is lagging behind , despite the fact that it has a higher percentage of instructions than those that are more successful than China or India .
That is why we need more Europe and a better , more united and more ambitious Europe .
I am sure that they are a step in the right direction .
The Greek Communist Party is against this and has voted against the amendments to adapt the regulation of the European Parliament to the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to make the following observation : it is very surprising that , while Albania &apos;s growth indicators are showing a steady increase of over 2 % in 2010 - in the middle of global economic instability - and that social tension is expected to reach 3 % in 2011 rather than improving now .
Human trafficking is also a serious problem within the European Union .
Then there are other issues that I would like to highlight , based on what Mr Paparizov said .
In Southern Sudan , the European Union must make a significant contribution to the stabilisation , development and strengthening of institutional capabilities .
As has been said , Amendment 13 to the Sri Lankan Constitution , which includes decentralisation in terms of regional administration by the resident population , must be implemented , and in this respect , the European Union can provide good help .
Despite this , I repeat , despite the differences that may arise and there are differences between the Commission and the Council , and also with some Members of Parliament , with regard to the regulation of ship transport , there are those who prefer to have different regulations for transport by road transport and maritime transport .
I agree with the rationale of this proposal , which is the need to establish a coherent and comprehensive framework for the development of investments in energy infrastructure in the Community , which will allow the Commission to monitor the state of development of the investment projects envisaged in the field of energy .
The beginning of this House was reassuring : in 1995 , a global consensus was reached that women and men are equal from all political , economic , legal and social points of view .
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are properly implemented , that there is a constant decrease in the level of corruption in the country , and that any abuse of power by those holding public positions is severely punished .
In summary , the Europe we are fighting for - a Europe of justice and social progress , economic and social cohesion , cooperation between states with equal rights , and a Europe that promotes peace - has little chance of being achieved with the general guidelines that this Commission proposes to follow .
From a democratic perspective and a legitimate perspective , it is important to inform our citizens of what the European Union does .
After the historical events that I have just mentioned , we in Germany would not do justice to our national unity unless we serve European unity .
To put it plainly , the same person will be held in the positions currently held by Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner .
As I said on a previous occasion in this House , my position is to see a Europe of nations cooperating .
- Report : Elles
In the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the PPE-DE Group abstained from voting .
Moreover , the mandatory nature of the register for all lobbyists who wish to have permanent access to Parliament and the Commission is an important step towards increasing the transparency of relations between these organisations and the European institutions .
By adopting the texts at first reading , Parliament lacked its rights .
This is a very important step that enables the human rights of European citizens to be implemented more effectively .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the vote on the Kirilov report will take place in a few weeks &apos; time , and I welcome it , as it is necessary to adopt it .
I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation , because many light commercial vehicles are bought by small and large companies that are already aware of the need for fuel savings and efficiency .
I propose a study on consolidated accounts .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to make a general comment , so I have two or three questions depending on the time you want to give me .
We must also remember that with Turkey in the European Union , we would have countries like Iraq , Iran and Syria at our borders .
I am convinced that we must , after all , realise that we cannot talk about economic policy without taking into account at any time the parameter of employment .
What would we expect of the European Union ?
We must not forget that every effort we take must be taken into account to our constituents , who are in a difficult time .
However , for the same reason , they can create a huge distortion of trade if their financing operations are not governed by common rules .
I am convinced that good governance of the Single Market can only be based on precise and good quality information on the functioning of the Single Market .
in writing . - ( ET ) Against the backdrop of the current global economic crisis ( i.e. the economic recession and rising unemployment ) , it is a fact that an increasing number of people will be dismissed in the European Union labour market , and the total number of people will be further increasing in the number of people affected by poverty and alienation .
Of course , they had already been a flag , and they had already been a national anthem , but they were wrong to build a new state .
Corporate social responsibility partially covers these issues , but they cannot be implemented without a national framework .
It is a real compromise .
In addition , appropriate operational assistance must be provided in the event of an accident , so as to offer passengers the services and goods they need most .
The Council supports this common text and , therefore , the President of the European Parliament can finally declare the budget adopted .
We must support the creation of private financing mechanisms and the most frequent adoption of public measures and legal initiatives aimed at strengthening the European resettlement programme .
The aim of this text is also to put an end to misleading advertising on the Internet which encourages people to buy products which not only treat them , but can be harmful to patients .
Mr President , I would like to table an oral amendment to this amendment deleting two of its parts , namely the words &apos; from the Colombian army &apos; and &apos; Colombia &apos; .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against the Roma in Europe .
Madam President , I think that this is once again one of those good reports that many people appreciate .
Once again , attention must be drawn to the excessive delays between the occurrence of the disaster , the decision to mobilise the EUSF and the effective provision of Community support to the Member States and the affected regions .
We need legal evidence , and we have asked the French Government to provide ourselves with the relevant dossiers for this .
Europe cannot be the sum of 27 national interests .
At the same time , Prime Minister Reinfeldt will present the report on the last six months of work of the Council .
The disadvantage of austerity measures , which do not allow workers to access the public sector , must be beneficial to new companies , thus exposing the spirit of enterprise through reduced constitutional costs for companies so that they can create a prosperous private sector , which is also the precondition for taking the various countries out of the current situation .
Both sides were unable to develop a shared vision and , as a result , progress has stalled .
I wonder whether this free trade agreement will only be in conformity with the world and the division of economic power between Europe and India today or still be valid in ten or fifteen years &apos; time .
The main aims of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access for the entire European Union by 2013 and fast Internet connections by 2020 .
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the global crisis , but is mainly due to the inability to take the necessary measures immediately after the crisis erupts in Moldova .
European workers and the poor of Europe must mobilise their power against these disastrous policies , and in favour of a genuine democratic and socialist Europe , which means opposing the policies of this new European Commission .
The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives defined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
The provisions on this matter are officially included in the Treaty on European Union and it must be taken into account when devising policies in areas such as the internal market .
It expresses itself first and foremost in the level of regions and their cultural heritage , and it is a good thing that will be taken into account and highlighted in the context of regional development policy .
I think that we need to focus our efforts on this .
We will need your strength of persuasion in order to give a new impetus to EU international trade policy .
This reserve is a &apos; accounting instrument &apos; which must be used in emergency accounts that could arise during the course of this year .
We see a minute &apos;s silence in memory of our Tunisian friends .
Many of the errors and a charge called the euro .
Taking into account the initiatives I have just described , I believe that there is now a solid basis on which we can improve the fisheries and aquaculture sectors through innovative research within the framework programme .
This debate is taking place from an overly technocratic perspective .
Therefore , I congratulate Mr Millán Mon his splendid report , which comes at such an appropriate time for strengthening relations between the two continents .
That is why we have seen a significant simplification of EU legislation .
The important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have , unfortunately , been rejected and , as a result , citizens living in the European Union , but without the nationality of a Member State , cannot sign initiatives , thus preventing the fair participation of citizens in the European Union , irrespective of their nationality , and there are guarantees that the signatures collected correspond to the numbers of the petitioners &apos; identities of the signatories .
I call for the creation of an independent committee composed of local and international jurists who are responsible for investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the violence that followed the fraudstal elections in December 2007 .
In addition , the credibility of NATO and what we call the West depends , to a large extent , on the results achieved in Afghanistan .
The process has degenerated and it must stop .
The drawing up of guidelines for private and public actors and the creation of a training system and mobility on how to implement multi-level governance policies in practice could be effective measures for improving regional policy .
I hope that my Spanish and Italian colleagues will join us , but we cannot wait any longer because the whole world follows the innovation market .
I also think it is right that we identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and that future strategies should be adapted to them from the next reform of the CAP .
Mr President , the ongoing negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Vietnam must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties .
While I welcome the adoption of some important measures proposed in this report , I would like to draw your attention to an essential aspect of the problem .
However , this method will not expose the economy and jobs to bureaucracy , to unfair competition , or to unforeseen price fluctuations .
This will have no adverse impact on cod stocks , because at the moment , superfluous catches of cod are very small .
The sanctions proposed are proportionate and necessary , and the hope is that they will discourage unfair commercial practices adopted by commercial operators .
In my opinion , this criterion is unreasonable and discriminatory because , as in the case of Portugal , most of these families live in accommodation of fortune in rural areas .
This measure for determining a situation of poverty is based solely on financial elements , without taking into account the differences between the 27 Member States , which basically includes solvency .
This will require both the resources of ODA and new funding .
The ethical evaluation of the project &apos;s activities has been successful and has been certified .
In my opinion , the recent proposal for cofinancing to 75 % is too high .
I would like to clarify two things , ladies and gentlemen .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Commissioner for drawing attention to the issue of Tunisia .
The rapporteur is saying , above all , that citizens are not aware of the rights that this would entail .
On the one hand , it is crucial to create a security , justice and freedom area within the European Union , in the wake of the European democratic model that we are building and many see as Europol as an instrument that can be adapted ; on the other hand , we believe that pooling resources - especially human resources , but also technical resources to fight organised crime and all sorts of illicit trafficking - must be subject to our citizens &apos; freedom of law , and that we must subject to our legal certainty , because it is subject to our greatest legal security and that of our legal certainty .
It is therefore vital to adopt any measures that will strengthen the certainty of the independence and transparency of impact assessments , as this will help maximise the role played by this instrument as a means of helping decision making and ensuring the quality and adequacy of the activities carried out by the EU institutions .
Secondly , the strategy should strengthen the Union &apos;s internal cohesion , in other words its convergence .
Moreover , this is not the way forward that the Commission has embarked on , given that its proposal - through the legislation that Parliament has approved - on the reform of the current system of agencies , which is private , and on the strict strengthening of transparency obligations in order to avoid conflicts of interest , reinforcing verticality in assessing the capacity of debt .
It also encourages the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of the creation of an independent European Credit Rating Foundation .
The Member States of the European Union , even before the crisis that we are facing today , were already faced with the social problems caused by weak economic growth , by a complex demographic situation and by the difficulties resulting from the fact that they are living in an increasingly globalised world economy .
However , there are reasons to be concerned about the danger that Moldova &apos;s enthusiasm will drop .
Parliament has always stretched the right of Tibetans to autonomy , which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence .
In anticipation of a directive that will soon be adopted , I voted with the other Members on a resolution setting out Parliament &apos;s guidelines on this matter .
In view of this , it is important to introduce a system for monitoring and monitoring medicinal products that will provide real information to patients .
It is a fight that is worth fighting , and that is exactly what I want to do .
These costs will always bear in mind some exceptions , provided that the state that requires them has a good justification .
This framework decision should not result in excessive red tape in cases where there are more suitable alternatives to the problems in question .
The ECB was not aware that a serious crisis was coming to an end and did not exactly brilliant in terms of regulation , not perfect .
However , as an organisation of major importance , the European Union should be better prepared to tackle these situations and , in particular , more prepared to react effectively to emergencies .
- Report : Kaczmarek
We should therefore support its inclusion only if these measures are not effective .
I made a commitment to inform the European institutions of this civil protest .
The European Union and the industrialised countries should have the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from a variable rate from 25 % to 40 % by 2020 and , in the long term , aim to reduce emissions by 80 % by 2050 compared with 1990 .
Report : Patrão Neves
At this point , I would like to go into the details of two issues that have still been raised repeatedly during the debate .
Firstly , on behalf of the Council , I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for its cooperation and spirit of compromise , which enabled us to reach an agreement within the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of passengers in bus and coach transport , especially disabled passengers or persons with reduced mobility .
One of the reasons is the fragmentation of our military equipment market .
At the beginning of this period , the theme of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy sources was an important point .
The creation of the EEAS will require a series of decisions , which will probably involve variations in the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , following a Commission proposal to be adopted by codecision .
We fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to establish an appropriate balance between resources .
in writing . - The situation throughout North Africa is very dangerous but , at the same time , it gives hope .
Coordination requires constant improvements and the responsibility of the Member States in this area must definitely be extended .
With their unambiguous vote , the Irish people are giving us the courage and strength to continue to flourish and to build a strong , and , above all , federal Europe .
If environmental protection and the protection of public health go hand in hand , I believe that we need to combine the needs of consumers and producers as well .
This is an enemy that we must resolve together .
We must cooperate with the largest consumer countries such as the United States , China , Russia and Japan in order to tackle this problem and create an alert system and a register of global illegal logging and countries with concerns using Interpol and a United Nations ad hoc body with the latest satellite detection technologies .
Of course , we cannot allow short-term support for the industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness .
I would like to point out that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
As a result of the effects of the current economic and social crisis , the fight against unemployment and social exclusion is the focus of the public and the European institutions .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to say that in my opinion , this is too important to continue living in the lies in which we have experienced in Europe .
Of course , as has been pointed out , we did not know the names of the candidates and we did not know a woman among them , although justice to Commissioner Barnier , this issue has been clarified properly .
We deplore the dropping rate in the European elections and the &apos; no &apos; vote in referendums .
We will have to ask you what happens and then we will inform you , Mr Coelho .
( PL ) Mr President , horizontal agreements are the subject of a wide range of regulations and control mechanisms laid down in the law - whether we like it or not - can kill competition .
We also need a more efficient and protective common European asylum system .
That concludes Question Time .
I also know that you all want Parliament to be involved in a form of police cooperation that is conducted in respect of human rights and the values of the European Union .
I will write that same horror in his Guernernernrasa , which is reproducing our Guernrasal soil from the Junker of Condor seven decades ago &apos;s legacy .
In this context , there will be someone who tries to speculate on difficult economic situations and sometimes makes them worse .
Mr Bové is right and Mrs Fajmon has profoundly ...
We must promote not only competitiveness , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution , and ensure agricultural diversity throughout Europe .
The Rapkay report amending the Staff Regulations in the context of the creation of the European External Action Service is an extremely important document along the path to establishing a European foreign policy .
We therefore believe and will be discussing this again at the first reading , that initial expenditure reflects our priority and we agree with the rapporteur , who stresses the issue of multilingualism and buildings - something that we have always considered to be a priority - in the light of the necessary legislative measures .
A few weeks ago , I had the honour of leading a delegation from Parliament &apos;s Committee on International Trade at the Seventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva .
That is where Europe will be able to move ahead .
I have asked the Member States to put forward proposals for nominations , including women &apos;s names .
Firstly , it is vital to maintain a geographical division with regard to the financial aid granted by the Union budget to Mediterranean countries and to Western Europe in accordance with the provisions of the financial perspective for the 2007-2013 period , while continuing to support these countries in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank .
We believe that Kosovo is an exceptional case and we want to stress that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States .
These attitudes are a sufficient reason for not inviting President Lukashenko to the European Union summit by welcoming the appeals of the Belarusian opposition .
It is essential to highlight the human and holistic elements of our policy , even when it comes to the internal market .
Mr President , I join my colleagues in what they have said about the rights of disabled travellers and Mrs Kadenbach about children , as well as the remarks about fire protection in hotels and , in particular , about the need for the new proposal to be adapted to future needs .
I wanted to ask you a question about gender balance in the Commission and also to take the opportunity to congratulate Baroness Ashton on her appointment .
It is clear from the report that Member States are the only competent authority in the field of defence and national security , which we believe needs to be emphasised .
Similarly , the Member States that were most concerned about asset stripping and hidden takeovers were those that were free of minimum reporting thresholds on equity participations and without informing contracts designated in English contracts for different purposes .
I would also like to thank Mr Lehne for his approach .
In other words , the Copenhagen Agreement refers to the level of ambition required to tackle climate change when reaching a climate agreement after 2012 , and lays the foundations for a financial package , hoping for serious commitments to reduce emissions .
AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis kill four million people every year .
From a more commercial point of view , I would like to ask the Commissioner for reassurance that ACTA cannot be used to combat the trade in medicines that are affordable at more competitive prices , safe medicines , generic medicines , which do not violate copyright but which have the greatest fault of being produced by emerging countries such as India and Brazil and may disrupt western pharmaceutical industries .
After all , Members have the right to speak .
That is unacceptable .
We want to make our contribution .
That is why we will have to find the right level of financial and technical compensation .
This is an area in which we must act more firmly in the context of competition policy and consumer protection policy .
It is just as shameful that these politicians claim that we accept the outcome of the second referendum when they themselves have not actually recognised the result of the first referendum .
As a co-author of the European Parliament motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan , I would like to thank my fellow Members who voted today in favour of this document .
Mr President , Minister , I will conclude with a suggestion for future generations .
It is essential to establish clear rules and objectives for the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) in order to strengthen the internal market in a sustainable way and to improve environmental quality within the European Union , as well as to restore raw materials of strategic importance .
The Heads of State or Government have also stressed that nuclear safety must not be restricted to the territory of the European Union , and that our neighbours will also be asked to carry out stress tests .
There must be a very clear distinction between the competences of military and humanitarian bodies , including a dialogue that promotes mutual understanding .
The Commission is working on a more systematic assessment of the quality of the allocation of public funds , including aspects of the budget according to its performance .
This will be a priority for me in my mandate as Trade Commissioner .
The Commission could therefore submit amendments or new proposals , in the event of this .
The US still needs to introduce clear and transparent criteria for rejecting the visa requirement in some Member States .
It is the issue of financing that remains open .
To some Members , I would like to say that we need constructive criticism of Turkey , we need to show that we are critical friends .
Studies have shown that the profits generated by trafficking in imans exceed the profits of drug trafficking and drugs .
From my side , farmers feel abandoned and openly insulted by people who are accused of not knowing what they are doing and who need someone who says it .
No .
That is why I voted for this resolution , which , given the negative impact of the liberalisation of the markets on local economies , stresses the strategic importance of reasonable customs protection .
Overall , I support the proposals put forward in this report which aim at the recovery of the European economy through greater financial support for energy projects .
It is therefore even more incomprehensible that the report on the European Refugee Fund , which calls for refugees to be resettled in the European Union .
This is an estimate that could increase .
economists use mathematical models to highlight the value of domestic work .
Only when we are fully informed can we talk about coherence in checks on the application of EU law .
I will repeat : in the strongest possible terms .
The European Union and the other international players , especially ahead of the Copenhagen conference , must develop their policies on international trade , climate change , humanitarian aid and development .
I refer to Commissioner Rehn &apos;s statement , to which I am re-estimating my personal esteem , and he said that Nigeria is a poor country : it is not true , Nigeria is a very rich country , but a country with a corrupt and incapable leadership who has plundered the country &apos;s resources and impoverished millions of citizens .
Finally , Mr Mölzer , this is not so pessimistic .
I therefore call on the Council to make a swift statement on this new Parliament proposal so that the ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010 , and I call on the Commission to also respect the producers and non-ACP exporters of social and environmental requirements in a spirit of reciprocity .
This requires the Commission , as coordinator of the Energy Community , to shield Ukraine and its obligations in the area of security of supply for Europe .
Of course , we regret the victims of all the aggressive and authoritarian regimes , whether they be atrocities committed in Europe or , for example , in the former European colonies .
The main objective of the regulation must be to introduce a new culture of control and responsibility rather than imposing a bureaucratic and costly process for controlling every single product .
Member of the Commission . - The current European competition policy with regard to vertical agreements fully supports online sales , and I am sure that you are aware of this , Mr President .
On the other hand , the report contains clear recommendations regarding the second and third of them all in the right direction .
As far as transport is concerned , it is necessary to impose certain restrictions on car manufacturers in order to develop engines with better performance .
The financial situation of some countries in the euro area - which is the subject of today &apos;s debate - clearly shows the risks that arise when we disagree with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact .
I therefore think that it would be absolutely appropriate to consider how we can make the best use of the financial resources spent in order to broaden the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery and to include a new monotemic instrument and , apparently , a necessary tool in support of energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewable energy sources .
The Commission , and we , too , in Parliament , have deliberately chosen not to address the issue of fund mergers , because we are starting from the assumption that the industry will keep its promise to resolve it alone , without legislative pressure .
That brings me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy .
( EL ) Madam President , as far as the manufacturing industry is concerned , I should like to remind this House that Pakistan is the world &apos;s fourth largest producer of cotton with 9 % of global production , whereas the European Union follows little less than 5.5 % of global production .
In this case , too , the Council , and especially Parliament , is also taking part in the decisions on the composition of the College , on the tasks that you will have and on the agenda that you are going to present for the next five years .
We have to understand that everything has only started for a year and that in 2009 , things should go on .
This situation is also reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people , because the country has entered a time of recession , the living conditions of workers and citizens are worsening , the inequalities are getting worse and poverty is increasing .
President of the Commission , President of the Council , these objectives already feature among those already included in the Europe 2020 strategy .
We have already worked with many Arab countries on initiatives to obtain gas through Turkey , hoping for the Nabucco pipeline .
Therefore , moving towards complete elimination is a health policy objective to which national governments will be able to make a greater contribution by means of elasticity .
As this is my last speech to this House , I would like to thank you , colleagues and officials for their good cooperation .
I am aware that there are currently significant differences between the electoral rules in the various Member States .
Often , the general doctors are too late in starting treatment with pesticides , so that they do not exceed the spending limit at their disposal , which is counterproductive .
Paradoxically , in practice , the instrument could easily be misused , not only by extremists , but also by very strong and powerful interest groups , and I say this because we believe that a threshold of 1 000 demonstrations of support is not very high compared with the EU &apos;s demographic potential .
Indeed , the 2010 budget provides for this systematic approach .
According to the report by the United Nations Working Group , victims of trafficking come from the most diverse social environments : they can be painted or very poor , educated or completely illiterate , very young or older women .
There remains one very important question .
Better and more comprehensive economic governance is needed , so that national initiatives support this direction and I refer in particular to the tax on financial transactions , which the Commission should consider very carefully in the European context .
I believe that mutual recognition of prescriptions is essential between Member States , as this is not only a matter of providing healthcare , but also of regulating the period after treatment for patients , but we still have time to define this retail .
Firstly , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for their reports , which raise some important issues about the contribution of the European Union &apos;s trade policy to the achievement of certain basic objectives of public policies : respect for human rights , the pursuit of economic prosperity and social justice , the achievement of sustainable growth and respect for the environment , in particular , for the climate system .
Consumers will be able to use a number of remedies if a product is purchased which is not in conformity with the contract and will be able to demand the damage if it is not repaired .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the reason for this urgency is the brutal murder of 57 people as a result of the body of a politician who was demonstrating herself as a candidate in the elections for the office of provincial governor .
This new intelligent and symmetric system will result in stricter surveillance , more accurate assessments by the Commission , the European Parliament , the Council and the European Central Bank , as well as the drawing up of recommendations on additional reforms and corrective plans .
Syrian citizens deserve long-awaited political reforms , especially with regard to freedom of expression , assembly , political participation and governance .
Many of them were British citizens , so they were the subject of this brutal practice in British territory and not outside it .
( FR ) Mr President , Madam President of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has resumed its growth in the third quarter of 2009 , which leaves the impression that the worst is behind us .
In this context , it is expected that Greece will adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of the public administration , continuing pension and health reforms , improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system , reinforcing the functioning of the market to consumers and the economic environment , while maintaining stability in the banking and financial sector .
We believe that when establishing agreements between sovereign states , it is essential to be guided by this : respect for the sovereignty of countries and their peoples , which is of mutual interest , reciprocity and cooperation , taking into account each country &apos;s particularities ; each country &apos;s contributions should be evaluated from the economic , social and cultural point of view of respect for the sovereignty of each country .
I believe that the transition to a green and sustainable economy can proceed without imposing excessive legislative measures .
Everyone seems to forget the contribution of the United States and , of course , NATO to peace in Europe .
I believe that we should consider it a golden opportunity to meet Europe &apos;s most pressing needs : economic growth , jobs , small businesses , innovation , more efficient public procurement - these are the things on which our citizens will judge us .
I think it is not our responsibility to anticipate the possible developments in these countries .
The second project concerns concessions .
Madam President , in the European elections of 2004 , Ireland introduced a smoking ban on the workplace and we found ourselves with many constituents who were outlawed and hungry .
In fact , at a time of profound contraction of state actions , the increase in the EU budget is a step towards trust in the common project and strengthening supranational interventions .
I am sure that our message is good , so let us use and disseminate it .
The report contains guidelines on how air agreements are evaluated in terms of content and procedures to be adopted .
The language law has an imbalance .
Perhaps on 1 December , after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , we can leave the debate on the internal policy of the United Kingdom out of the House .
That is the difference between the real situation and the illusions of the European Parliament .
We also support the need for the national parliaments to be fully associated , in accordance with their respective budgetary and control powers , in order to increase transparency , ownership and accountability of the decisions taken at European level as well .
Mr President , five more and two questions have been asked , respectively , on economic governance and the Europe 2020 strategy .
That is why I consider it appropriate to involve the national authorities actively in promoting SOLVIT , the European Commission and also Members of this House .
It is a system based on real policies and guidelines , and now , Mr Michel , on genuine protagonists and liberal rhetoric that led us to this situation : promoting the agri-industrial model , in line with the safeguarding of the interests of the great agri-food industry , resulting in poor quality of the agricultural sector in the world ; and years of inadequate investment in agriculture , and the promotion of agricultural abandonment of farming , and the promotion of farming farming abandonment of the sector , and of the supply of food , and of the supply of the small-scale , and of the small-scale livelihood of subsistence of subsistence of subsistence - and medium-sized enterprises .
From an economic perspective , the amount paid to producers is lower than their costs of production , and the CAP must enable us to resolve this problem .
Once again , I call on the Commission to continually insist , in its contacts with that government , that this promise be respected until Congo adopts a legally binding rule on this matter .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I fully understand the great interest that this Parliament has in the action taken within the European Union and elsewhere to address the challenges faced by some Member States in relation to their public finances .
We sympathise with the will of those nations that eat a better life , autonomy and a shorter future .
You also have the support of the Irish members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that must be promoted in all ways to make the world more free , fairer and more social in the future .
It was my office that produced the work document on sanctions in Syria ; it was we who led .
The day we are able to get rid of poverty , the spectrum of Communism will actually disappear .
The next item is the debate on the oral question by Mrs Bowles , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the revision of the rules on horizontal competition cooperation - B7-0565 / 2010 ) .
That is why you have fought together , with orange and with the blue .
I believe that this procedure , in addition to strengthening the food security of the EU &apos;s public , introduces greater clarity for Member States and countries exporting meat products to the EU .
In this situation , it seems unwise to pursue an agreement with Mercosur , all the more so as the Swedish Institute for Food and Technology has pointed out that the ambitious footprint of Brazilian meat is 35 times higher than that of Irish beef .
Therefore , as agreed with the Council , at the end of Rule 1 ( 4 ) of the original regulation , Article 1 ( b ) of the amending regulation should be added the following paragraph : &apos; The same exchange rates for the annual revision of tariffs as Articles 4 , 4 ( 3 ) and 6 ( 3 ) ( 3 ) shall be applied in the form of the same tariffs as different euro &apos; ) &apos; ) .
Today , the Irish Government called for European solidarity , and rightly so .
Just look at the example of Ireland , which has been hit particularly hard by the crisis : its membership of the monetary union has protected it from a crisis of even greater proportions .
He fears that the Germans will make demands for goods in the Sudeten and , having listened to German politicians on this subject , I think he is absolutely right to be afraid .
an increase in European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund aid , combined with increased financial support for technical activities relating to the development and implementation of projects ;
If we do not ensure that countries realise this and do not prevent the implementation of economically irrational policies , it will have serious consequences for everyone .
We must enhance and promote further activities aimed at tackling the issue of climate change .
( Applause from the left )
As always when issues are particularly complex , I have had enormous cooperation from my shadow team - Mrs Vergnaud , Mr Buşoi and Mrs Rühle .
Mr President , freedom of the press and the media in Russia is indeed a major problem .
In the same way , it is up to each Member State to decide whether to sign or ratify the framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which are the two most important instruments introduced by the Council of Europe .
This is a structured dialogue that provides us with the opportunity to exchange views on issues that we consider important .
Thirdly , the area of sustainability , with people who , already included in the labour market , need protection and support both in order to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and then , in a year or two time , to review the whole cycle of new training and retraining in order to find new jobs , and in order to maintain existing jobs .
Madam President , our demands were made with the intention of highlighting the benefits that our citizens may expect from this package of measures and that this package could offer them .
I voted in favour of this report because it introduces substantial improvements to the Commission &apos;s text , particularly with regard to the protection of personal data .
We have also carried out a review of the unused funding of 2009 so that a total of EUR 1.9 billion could be made available for energy and EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II .
Thank you for your proposal and for the clarity of your message .
We find in the text a part of this document and an attempt to adopt the holistic approach , which has not managed us as well as we were imagined , but which nevertheless goes in the right direction .
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission , despite its unbemoniency , and the Council , with which we have sought to find reasonable solutions in night sittings and in many dialogues , and I thank them for the fact that only one hour ago they also adopted the reasonable compromise that we put forward .
In order to ensure the adoption of comprehensive and coordinated measures , the Commission , together with Eurocontrol , established the European Centre for Crisis Coordination in the aviation sector , following the Council of Transport Ministers held on 4 May 2010 .
At the same time , it is important to remember that it is rarely the problem itself - in this case , illegal logging - that creates conditions for the illegal trade in timber .
I come from a country , Portugal , and from a region , the Azores , where the dairy sector is very important and deeply rooted in regions that are socially fragile and where it would be crucial to maintain the quota system beyond 2015 .
People are not the product of different cultures , but cultures are the product of different peoples .
In some cases , they are , in fact , such that we should consider them .
( SV ) Mr President , Iceland is a small nation in terms of its population , with around 300 000 inhabitants , but it is a great nation .
Mr President , MEPs have an important role to play in supervising health claims decisions .
For this reason , yes to our Nabucco side , but in just as strongly the decision to support our governments &apos; efforts to diversify supply is a guarantee of the wellbeing of our populations .
It is possible to spread political parties , the legal system is broken , there are human rights abuses , freedom of speech and assembly in countries such as Britain and most other European states .
We obviously need an energy mix that comprises various sources of energy and on the basis of the broadest possible basis , because that will stabilise the energy situation and improve the conditions of each individual nation , and hence of the whole of Europe .
In any case , the fact that Parliament is calling for international law to condemn certain unfortunate practices , when the legal basis is actually not clear , leaves me sceptical .
By voting on this motion for a resolution on Tunisia , I wanted to express my explicit support for the cause of the Tunisian people and its historic democratic revolution .
Parliament also calls on the Member States to take appropriate measures and effective policies , such as national action plans or targeted social actions , to reduce energy poverty and to draw up regular reports on their actions in this context .
If a law is passed through the Hungarian Parliament and it is stated that , from now on , only by a two-thirds majority , you know that it will not be easy to amend it again after the subsequent elections .
Generalised tariff preferences ( debate )
Today , we voted in plenary on the recommendation &apos; Harmonised Conditions for the marketing of construction products &apos; .
This new sense of mutual trust involves another major problem .
This year , we allocated an additional sum of EUR 9.5 million for the EEAS , but it will only be possible to define the real costs after the first year of operation , when a report on the expenses incurred for the service will be submitted to the European Parliament .
I personally wonder about Pakistan , whose chronic instability , as we all know , is a factor in the crisis for the whole region and also for Afghanistan .
Of course , we cannot ignore the fundamental biological differences that exist between men and women .
However , we must not forget certain factors , including the idea contained in the proposal on the allocation of infrastructure charges .
( HU ) Mr President , what I welcome in this directive is a more accurate definition of patients &apos; rights , the end of interminable waiting lists and the solution proposed if no professionals are available in a given country .
Mr President , I would like to make a few comments on the issues and issues that have emerged from the debate .
Last week , in committee , I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a fantasy Presidency .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran , as I am concerned about the constant human rights violations in Iran , particularly with regard to freedom of association , expression and information , and also because I support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people .
In particular , it will be very important to finance the launch of projects quickly .
One thing is to create a mechanism , but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to European citizens so that they can make full use of it .
This agreement will not only increase the competitiveness of the Canadian and European markets , but will also increase their safety , in the context of the approximation of the regulatory authorities and enforcement authorities , which will then be able to cooperate in all matters of certification , inspections and enforcement of the rules so as to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights .
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant .
Moreover , its private dimension not only strengthens Europe &apos;s image in the world , but also promotes European citizenship .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal that we are discussing today is aimed at amending the regulation adopted in 2004 , which improved and harmonised security standards relating to the fraudulent use of passports and travel documents for EU citizens , while also introducing elements of biometric identification .
Secondly , we need to create a kind of temporary institutional framework for the mechanism for implementing decisions .
Turning to positive notes now , some of the agreements concluded over recent times are very good , for example , the free trade agreement with Korea .
For these reasons , Parliament must once again remind the Commission of the social clause in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also hope that Belgrade realises that , rather than constantly trying to rewrite history , it is far more effective to plan constructive work with the European Union .
Although it may appear paradoxical , the Commission has not , to date , found either the necessary arguments or the time to put pressure on the Latvian Government to put an end to this discrimination on linguistic grounds .
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to link any help to the Pakistani Government to the abolition of such a pernicious discrimination against Pakistan &apos;s religious minorities .
This will be an effective instrument for combating illegal immigration , organised crime and human trafficking .
However , there is also the right to observe their faith .
Of course , more than in any other case , it is necessary for financial institutions to stop reviewing their approach at some point .
The common objective that we managed to achieve in committee is to reduce by-catches and discards .
The main objective of aid for trade is to increase the national and international competitiveness of 48 States .
While accepting the logic of internalisation of external costs as a good starting point , it is , in the end , unsustainable that , in order to reduce traffic congestion , only heavy goods vehicles are penalised and not ordinary cars are being penalised , so the old &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle would be applied in a clearly discriminatory way .
I was encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary debate .
In addition , looking at the starting point , we have some concerns .
The main objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States - whether they are centre right or centre left - is to safeguard the continuing profitability of monopolies by weighing the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on working classes throughout the European Union .
It is therefore necessary to promote the spread of good practice and to raise awareness of the potential offered by ICT .
Mr President , we were unable to hear the simultaneous translation in English of the previous speech .
However , in the face of this recast , this codification , there is a very important aspect that concerns the whole reprogramming of TEN-T networks over the next decade .
( LT ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the Ukrainian people , but let us not forget that it is also very important for the citizens of the European Union , because Ukraine is our important partner , especially in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe .
That is why the Commission must make its voice heard loud and clear .
You cannot interfere in a matter where the competence is exclusively the government of the United States of America .
The perpetrators of the forest heritage are being mixed , if not null , to meet these invisible and unknown functions of many citizens .
Unfortunately , it should also be said that the list of unresolved problems does not look at anything else .
With regard to the excellent report by Mr Salafranca on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America , I would like to ask the Council and the Commission , both represented here and here by Baroness Ashton , to take action on three fronts .
There are large dealers with a strong market presence in some Member States , and there are many small dealers that are more favourable to our current proposals than the measures that have been in force since 2002 , because they have noticed that certain aspects , which the legislator had not taken into account in 2002 , were not favouring them , were complicating their position in competition with large dealers .
It must build the &apos; EU regional political partnership for peace , security and development &apos; that the Horn of Africa has begun with the adoption of its report in April 2007 .
In recent years , in particular , following the historical enlargement of 2004 , the context and ambitions of the common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) have suffered a genuine revolution .
Spain is taking up the baton of the Presidency of the European Union at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force .
In this respect , it is important that the first European radio spectrum programme be in line with the objectives outlined in the EU2020 strategy and the &apos; Digital Agenda &apos; , and that it be part of the priority actions of the Single Market Act .
I would like to give my full support to Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposal .
The Commission &apos;s proposal has been amended in line with the report that is now being put to the vote , following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
Consequently , it is important to reach agreement at first reading .
These are the people who are most in need and should not be excluded because of their location .
Any medical assistance , irrespective of the specific characteristics , forms part of the scope of the Treaty on European Union .
However , I would like to point out to Parliament that a recent study carried out by the European Society of Carmetology has once again demonstrated the serious limitations of this methodology due to women &apos;s lack of participation in tests .
The idea is not to use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , but nor should it prevent us from achieving our objectives at social and environmental level .
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the recovery of organic waste , especially in this mainly agricultural region , to carry out a verification of data and to introduce a system for exchanging best practices .
There is a law that is completely incomprehensible and which requires premises , bishops and orthodox patriarts to be Turkish citizens .
The most significant element of the position adopted by Parliament is the focus it draws on the fragmentation of measures , which can therefore fail to lack a certain amount of cohesion , not only as a body of legislation , but especially in terms of implementation .
( RO ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon guaranteed the European Union &apos;s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
If nothing else , the issue of the digital Single Market has been a turning point in the Union &apos;s priorities .
It would be a significant step forward in the direction of transparency , openness and clarity of the European process .
( DE ) Mr President , I support the proposal by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , as I believe that it makes sense to discuss this issue .
However , is this the model of economic development that Europe wants to propose to its citizens ?
As a rule , I do not permit the speakers to exceed the time set , but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela &apos;s speech was particularly important to us .
We want a proper strategy based on new technologies , innovation and investment , a strategy which , once implemented , ultimately improves the quality of life for all European citizens in the Danube region .
This is a great achievement : without going into the scope of the legal basis , the directive recognises the irrefutable rights of the patient and opens up a new range of opportunities in access to better care .
Year on year , the Court of Auditors is unable to ensure that the EU budget is spent legally and regularly , and I was really concerned about the control of taxpayers &apos; money when I was the European Commission &apos;s accounting stock in 2002 .
This is a major challenge for me and a great honour .
If we are honest , we must recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and that our per capita emissions are much higher than those of China or India , for example .
I am sure that the dialogue that will arise from this will be constructive .
We therefore regret the fact that , as with Europol , haste has taken precedence over the desire to safeguard fundamental freedoms .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal , which aims to introduce an additional , simpler , additional method in order to use funds from the European Social Fund so that its capacity to respond to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing is quicker and more effective .
Quite honestly , I should have voted against the Commission &apos;s proposal for a composition , but together with the weak candidates , there have also been a number of very valid candidates , including the Polish candidate , Mr Lewandowski .
President of the Commission . - You are very kind , Mr Kirkhope , but as well as Britain , there are 26 other Member States in the European Union , so you will understand that , alongside the great attention you have expressed , I have to listen to other legitimate concerns as well .
We must be careful and maintain the neutrality of the EU &apos;s humanitarian response , although it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas .
It also contains new points to what Parliament has said in the past , for example , as it asks that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission evaluate the results of the investigations carried out by all sides and report on the European Parliament , recalls that the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States involve monitoring of the investigations carried out in connection with the latter &apos;s recent attacks , and that they have also expressed their concerns about their concerns about the recent attacks on them , and about their NGOs .
I also hope that this decision will help to save endangered species .
I hope that you will take my questions not as a provocation , but as a contribution to your reflection .
Personally , I am always open - and I hope that you will - to explain what we have been able to achieve , but we need to check the information .
This will strengthen the EU &apos;s position in international trade negotiations and , in particular , in the current round of Doha Round of the World Trade Organisation .
The same is true of the G20 summit : if Europe speaks with one voice , then the United States of America will be doing so .
That is why I am in favour of supporting the prices for European tobacco farmers , at least as long as Europeans continue to smoke .
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States , it is clear that some countries are taking this issue more seriously than others .
I would therefore like the European Social Fund ( ESF ) to be independent , separate from European structural policy .
The number of new infections continues to exceed the expansion of treatment , and two thirds of people who would need treatment in 2009 have lost their jobs , meaning that 10 million people did not have access to the necessary care .
On the contrary , where the value of the dignity of the human being is recognised , minorities are not considered in any way negative .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s proposals to simplify this fund .
In future , all EU institutions should ensure that our budgets are designed to help citizens and businesses to overcome times of economic difficulty and plan for recovery .
The best way to punish them , the most effective and practical way of all measures from the bottom up , is to support civic initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions .
To those who are fighting this treaty today , in the erroneous conviction that the European Union should be strengthened , I object to those who oppose the Treaty actually strengthening our so-called partners or , if you like , our opponents .
The EU &apos;s accession to this form of global capitalism will stifle us all .
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting at which the Commission will insist on the development of an alternative transport network .
You will remember the firm struggle that comes from the Court of Justice and the Commission - and I must pay tribute to the European Commission , which shows great clarity , much more than the Council on that occasion - with our full support .
The first person who asked for the floor this morning was Mrs Madlener .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski &apos;s report on the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community .
( DE ) Mr President , the line adopted by the governments of the key Member States of the European Union , the European Commission and the European Central Bank is clearly visible .
I would like to remind the House that , according to the recent census , there are even more than 20 million unemployed people in the European Union , which has probably now reached 25 million , which means that attracting more asylum seekers is actually a kind of mass suicide .
It is up to the Commission , not the finance ministers , to impose sanctions .
Sri Lanka is dependent on economic recovery from direct foreign investments and on EU economic support .
We fully endorse the objective of the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative , but we could not accept the quotation that puts forward to another vote by Parliament , which , among other things , supports abortion and contradictory compared to a previous explanation of vote , which we made in Parliament &apos;s verbatim record .
This document is the result of a compromise resulting from long negotiations , and it strengthens the implementation of passenger rights without additional burdens for operators .
Indeed , the time has come for the &apos; E &apos; economic and monetary union to live through the creation of a genuine and effective economic union as a final step towards the integration of European economic policies .
I have had a special interest in children &apos;s rights and their role in foreign relations .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union has been trying for 10 years to equip itself with legislative instruments in the area of economic immigration .
Mrs Stihler &apos;s report is a useful instrument for breaking down national administrative and technical barriers which prevent construction products from being marketed within the European Union and continuing to build a single market in this area .
I believe that , if we really want to respect the objectives that the treaties have set for our foreign policy , we still have a lot of water under the bridge before the EU remains in Libya immigrants who are staying illegally on its territory .
That is why I supported the resolution on the European Innovation Partnerships as part of the flagship initiative , and I believe that we should all engage in innovation initiatives , because , as I said , it is very important for the future .
We have a newly-elected government in the UK which has made promises in this area .
The next item is the report by Mr Alves , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 247 / 2006 laying down specific measures in the agricultural sector for the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255 / 2009 - .
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand to give us a positive result , both in terms of the environment and in terms of job creation .
In some Member States , the allocated European structural funds are not being fully spent : around 30 % or 40 % remain unused .
I therefore wonder - although the Commission has said that it has the necessary information , which is now in the process of publication - why do we know nothing about this .
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I firmly support the proposal to conduct an effective information campaign to increase the visibility of points of single contact .
It is rather odd that the Spanish Presidency calls for us to combat the economic crisis and to make the implementation of economic policy objectives mandatory .
Today , I voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation on unitary patent protection because the impasse which has been created in the Council as a result of the linguistic regime is unjustified .
I repeat : the Treaty clearly states that a Member State cannot be forced to take on a debt .
I would remind you that the European Parliament and the Council agreed to declare 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
I was able to reassure this Parliament that we will continue to raise these issues , even at a high level , and we call on the People &apos;s Republic of China to its international human rights obligations .
I hope - and I am confident I trust - that your votes will lay the foundations for an agreement .
I am sorry that Commissioner McCreevy is not here - perhaps the season has started again !
You may not be unaware of this , but you need complex animal testing , for example , in order to be able to check that kind of thing .
One aspect that causes me some concern , Commissioner , is the considerable influence that the CARS 21 Group and the industry have on a process that moves forward here .
We do not agree .
The EU aid provided for the 2007-2010 period aimed at supporting the development of democracy and good governance in the Republic of Moldova amount to more than EUR 50 million .
Of course , we fail to understand how an illegal worker can be employed and then the person who will take it to cover his or her expenses of residence and livelihood is punished .
I believe that this measurement system based on the demonstration of various curricula of study will result in political decisions that are better suited to the needs of society and the economy in general .
At the same time , I would like to stress that political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be directly subordinated and directly linked to the elimination of restrictions on freedom and the end of the repression of participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists .
Finally , Baroness Ashton , you will visit the Middle East .
In addition , the US Congress acted as a rebuffer by launching the Americans Serber-Christmas Act to just one month after the ICC was established in July 2002 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would just like to say briefly that this report includes the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , following the resolution that our plenary adopted on 19 June 2008 , and that this resolution rejected the Commission &apos;s proposal , which wanted to authorise the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption , even if these were to be subject to antimicrobious treatment .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to express my personal solidarity with the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my greatest concern at the four other Cuban prisoners and the opposition activist who began his hunger strike by protest .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 2010-2014 multiannual programme on freedom , security and justice ( Stockholm Programme ) .
Our motto should be that we do not waste one single cent .
The Union and the Mediterranean countries have always been at the forefront of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people , as it is vital that the principle of solidarity is solidarity with populations living in these problems .
The workers themselves are often isolated and access to trade unions is very complicated in such a situation .
( Laughter and applause )
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the two Commissioners and the Commission for today &apos;s speeches .

( EL ) Madam President , in connection with what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of each individual proposal , I should like to know whether it is possible to carry out an ex ante study for the relevant area , not least on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the specific characteristics of the area , so that there are criteria that all countries should be taken into account from the outset and within the scope of their design .
We must also look at the issue of Roma women , who are particularly affected by poverty problems , the problems inherent in the policies on the allocation of housing , discrimination and violence , and the issue of young Roma , because , as a result of their lack of qualifications , it is all the more difficult for them to access employment at this time of economic crisis .
