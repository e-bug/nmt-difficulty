As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), we support cooperation in the field of illegal immigration as long as we clearly specify that we are simultaneously preparing our attack on legal immigration.

In terms of production and employment, there are currently only a few nights left in the sectors of the high medium-sized/medium-sized world, luxury and high technology.

I very much welcome the adoption of this report because it gives a voice to the common feelings of the people most targeted by it, since it deals with promoting research and innovation, which are the engines for the European Union's current and future growth: the need to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of the projects, while strengthening the scientific and technological evaluation process.

I would like to ask you whether, in the final remarks, you could address some of these very real issues so that people can see that they are debated.
You have just mentioned five points, but the context - the idea that Europe 2020 will mean that economic problems, social problems, environmental problems will also be resolved - the lost or at least we see the risk of this happening.
That is not my words.
As a result, a very large majority is now in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, including the majority of your fellow citizens.

(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report, but I want to raise an important point in this regard.
I supported this resolution with the clear aim of sending the message that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs are with the Haitian people in long-term action to rebuild the infrastructure, communities and lives that have been destroyed.

We had a problem with the nomination of the 18 additional Members of this House, because certain Member States did not actually plan a procedure, but we decided that representation is the most important issue, that this is the principle on which we must focus, and that this Parliament should have balanced representation as quickly as possible.
As has already been said here, the judicious use of land, economic and social development in harmony with the nature and strengthening of cohesion in the European Union are also vital factors for disaster prevention.

We can talk about 2020, but today we have a more urgent problem: the euro area and Greece.
Information and communication technologies (ICT) represent an important sector, not least because of the hardship they are facing in the European economy: they account for 7% of the European labour force and 6% of GDP, that is, a significant part of the European economy and European production.
I believe that we can expect a whole series of initiatives that will call on the Commission to do more, to have a deeper Europe, and the Commission will doubtless respond very enthusiastically to this request.
Because if we do not assume our responsibilities and if we do not take a clear line, what Mrs Toia said earlier will have been pointless: we must be aware that by 2020, all Europeans must be able to follow their interests by what is, after all, the opportunities that we have already established in the Digital Agenda.
Such organisations build up their strength by responding to the daily needs of the people, which they then strengthen by terror.

I would also like to point out that we can help third countries, as the previous speaker said.
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential, even if it concerns only 1% of national health budgets, because in addition to these figures, we should concentrate on the symbol of every European citizen's legitimate right to be treated abroad and be reimbursed for treatment, with all the correct information.
However, as a primary form of prevention, I appeal for the introduction of measures to encourage healthy lifestyles as an essential factor in improving health status.
Given the heterogeneous nature of the legal regulations in the Member States and the often limited influence on the application of international law in relation to the fight against violence, it is becoming increasingly obvious the need for clear and binding regulations at EU level on this issue.

Adoption of Amendment 43 should not lead to the rejection of Amendment 54, because in 54 there are other issues which are not covered by 43.

If we were in the Roman Senate of anticity, a senator was certainly up, embraced in his autumn, and would say to Mr Trichet: Quousque tanabutere, Tricels, pathnic? - how long would you intend to try our patience, Mr Trichet?
Finally, Mr President, if I may, in order to spill any doubts that may exist, I would like to propose the creation in the European Parliament of an investigation committee on this issue.
Services concessions have been intentionally excluded from the public procurement directives to ensure greater flexibility in these areas and to take account of cultural differences.
I agree with some other ideas that have been expressed, but I think it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and understandable.
I believe that this network could be very useful, but at the moment, it does not work in a real way and does not make full use of its potential.
It is, of course, true that EPAs are different from the Lomé Conventions and the Cotonou Agreement, which have embodied the Union's relations with ACP for 30 years, but unilateral preferences that characterise those conventions have become open for discussions in the World Trade Organisation by other developing countries.
However, while we fully support the integration of the Roma population into the European Union, we have serious reservations about the European Union's involvement in issues that we consider to be the competence of individual nation states, such as access to healthcare, education, employment and housing.
It is also essential to prioritise food security, agriculture, infrastructure, capacity building and, in particular, economic growth and access to technology, as well as the human and social development of the countries concerned.
We cannot carry on like this.
The ultimate objective is better implementation of EU legislation and, therefore, healthy animals and decent living conditions for the animals concerned.
What action will you take to encourage rich countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis?

If we want to avoid closure, we must retain the operating rate to 30%.
We must resolve urgent priorities in this regard.
Cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing the productivity gap caused by the crisis, but also to restoring productivity.
It is a very important issue for all EU citizens and the way the Commission and Parliament deal with it says a great deal about accountability and transparency.
In short, let me stress that all the non-conventional measures that we have adopted in the period of acute financial tension are temporary and have been designed to take into account the possibilities for exit.
This report is appalling by what it says about the conduct of this Parliament.
the strict organisation of projects, the efficient use of resources and clarity regarding the length of projects;
Patients are currently unable to do so and are, as you say, subject to risk.
I would also like to say from the outset that I support all Turkey's efforts and moves towards democratisation.
In this Commission proposal, the concept of micro-enterprises is extended to define them as companies which, on the balance sheet date, do not exceed two of the following criteria: a balance sheet of EUR 500 000, a figure of EUR 1 000 and/or an average number of 10 employees during the financial year.
However, we have to fulfil our commitment to climate change: everyone recognises that we are world leaders on this issue.
rapporteur. - Madam President, you have caught me slightly unprepared because we did not see the substantial amendment of today's programme, but I am very grateful for the opportunity to address the House on a very important issue relating to the financial services sector, namely, the area of insurance and reassurance, as to what I did with the report on Solvency II and how, I think, I have now been put before the European Parliament, a very concrete basis.
It is therefore absolutely essential to move on to 30% and I will conclude by avoiding Barack Obama saying that we could give in to the jobs of the future of our competitors or we could take advantage of the century, as they have already begun to do.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make four comments.
For this reason, I and several other Members have invited an expert, who has investigated the trade in organs and the deliberate murder of people in China for transplants, to come and speak tomorrow.
President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank you for the constructive and extensive report, and we wish you all the best for your presidency!
These initiatives, which are facilitated by the EC funds, bring us together to work specifically on specific projects and programmes, which combine the strength of each institution and thus provide an excellent piece of work to shape the development of our joint work.
(SK) Once again we have a problem that involves respect for the rights of ethnic minorities in Slovakia, and it is the fault of the minister for education, which is a member of the extremely nationalistic government party.
For the sake of the necessary guarantees, such as Europeans making an administrative appeal and enjoying the same treatment as citizens of the United States, and the drastic shortening of the time that information is being stored, cooperation between Europe and the United States is, in this case, due to the negative effects of globalisation.
The EIB can and must play an important role in managing recent events in the Mediterranean.
I therefore support the call for an investigation into the profit margin of the production and distribution chain.
However, if the'polluter pays' principle is always considered most important - and I am ready to discuss this issue with you - then it is the Member States that cause congestion because it does not provide the necessary infrastructure.
The first is student mobility appropriations.
It is important, however, to be aware that, although it is quite intense at the southern borders of Europe, here we have an opportunity to increase the affection and link that citizens have with what Europe means: added value in terms of response to emergency situations.
Today's Europe is flooded, despite the fact that it has a larger proportion of the educated population than more prosperous countries, such as China or India.
That is why we need more European spirit and a better Europe: a more united and ambitious Europe.
I am sure that this is a step in the right direction.
The Greek Communist Party opposes and voted against the amendments intended to adapt the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following comment: it is very surprising that, while the growth indicators for Albania are constantly rising, with an increase of more than 2% in 2010, in the middle of global economic instability, and estimated to reach 3% in 2011, however, social tension is getting worse.
Human trafficking is still a serious problem across the European Union.
There are other issues that I would stress, as an echo to what Mr Paparizov has said.

As you said, Article 13 of the Sri Lankan constitution, which provides for decentralisation of regional administration by the people living there, and the European Union can provide valuable support here.
Of course, let me repeat, there may be differences of opinion, and there are differences between the Commission and the Council and even between certain Members of this House regarding the regulation on ship transport; some people prefer separate legislation for inland and sea transport.
I support the reasoning behind the proposal, namely the need to define a consistent and all-inclusive framework for the development of investments in energy infrastructure in the Union, which will allow the Commission to monitor the level of development of planned investment projects for the energy sector.
It was encouraging: in 1995, a global consensus was reached that women and men are equal in every respect, including political, economic, legal and social.
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are properly implemented in the country and are vigilant in terms of the permanent fall in corruption levels in Serbia and the application of severe sanctions to those who abuse their position.
In conclusion, the Europe that we are fighting for - a Europe of justice and social progress, economic and social cohesion, cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights, and a Europe that promotes peace - has little chance of being achieved with the guidelines that this Commission proposes to follow.
From the perspective of both democracy and legitimacy, it is important to communicate to our citizens what actions the European Union is doing.
We Germans would not have done justice to our national unity if we had not seen it as a contribution to the unity of Europe, following the historic events that we have described here.
Quite simply, the same person fulfils the powers of Javier Solana and Beniter Ferrero-Waldner.
As I have said on another occasion in plenary, I stand before you as a person wishes to see a Europe comprising the nations of which they cooperate.
- Report: Elles
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats abstained in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Furthermore, the binding nature of the register for all lobbyists who want permanent access to Parliament and the Commission is an important step towards improving the transparency of relations between these organisations and European institutions.
However, if we adopt everything at first reading, Parliament will be on its own of its own.
This is a very important step, which allows a more effective application of the fundamental rights of European Union citizens.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Kirilov report will be voted on in the coming weeks, and I welcome this, because the need is urgent.
Personally, I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation, because most vans are bought by companies, both large and small, which are already well aware of the need for efficiency and fuel saving.
I propose an analysis of the consolidated accounts.
(DE) Madam President, I have a general comment to make and then ask two or three questions, depending on how long you have given me.
We must also bear in mind that, with Turkey as a Member State of the European Union, Iraq, Iran and Syria will be on our borders.
I believe that we must finally understand that we cannot talk about economic policy without always taking account of the employment parameter.
What would we expect from the EU?

I believe that there can only be good governance of the Single Market if there is good and current information on the functioning of the Single Market.
in writing. - (ET) At the moment of the economic crisis (i.e. the growing economic recession and unemployment), the fact that more and more people will be made redundant is a reality in the EU labour market, which will result in the total number of people suffering from poverty and alliance in Europe constantly rising.
Of course they already had a flag, and they had a national anthem already, but they were able to make a new state.
These issues are covered to a certain extent by corporate social responsibility, but they cannot be implemented without a national framework.
It is a true compromise.
At the same time, appropriate operational assistance must be provided in the event of an accident, giving passengers the services and items they need most.
The Council accepts this common text and the President of the European Parliament can thus declare the approved budget.
We must support the creation of private funding mechanisms and the adoption of more frequent public and legal initiatives to strengthen the European resettlement programme.
On the other hand, we also intend to put an end to misleading advertising on the Internet, which encourages people to buy products that not only sell but can even harm patients.
Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to this amendment by deleting two parts of it, namely the words' by the Columbian army'and' on Columbia'.
I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and initiatives to directly and indirectly combat Roma discrimination in Europe.
Madam President, I think this is one of those reports that many people can welcome very warmly.
Once again, we must draw attention to excessive delays between the emergence of the disaster, the decision to mobilise the EUSF and the effective delivery of European support to the affected Member States and regions.
We need to have legal proof, and that is why we have asked the French Government to make our dossiers available to us concerning citizens.
Europe cannot just be the sum of 27 national interests.
In the meantime, Mr Reinfeldt is about to present the report from the last six months of work of the European Council.
The disadvantage of austerity measures, which will lead to workers losing their jobs in the public sector, being reversed to the advantage of newly established companies, taking advantage of the spirit of enterprise by reducing the costs of setting up businesses so that they can create the profit sector needed to get out of the crisis for all countries.
The two entities failed to develop a common vision, so the process has stagnated.
Is this free trade agreement adapted only to a world and a division of economic power between Europe and India, as we know today, or will this agreement be equally timely in ten or 15 years' time?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access for the entire EU by 2013 and fast Internet connections by 2020.
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only the consequence of the global crisis, but primarily the lack of immediate action needed since it began in the Republic of Moldova.
European workers and poor in Europe must mobilise their force against these disastrous policies and a truly democratic and socialist Europe, and that means opposing the policies of this new European Commission.
The European Parliament defends its prerogatives, as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Animal welfare requirements are now officially included in the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when we establish policies in sectors such as the internal market.
This first appears at the level of regions and cultural heritage and represents an advantage that will be taken into account and emphasised in the context of regional development policy.
I believe that we must now focus our efforts on this issue.
You will need all your conviction to be able to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU.
Indeed, this reserve is a'accounting' method that should be used for emergencies that may occur during the current financial year.
Please keep a minute's silence in memory of our Tunisian friends.
Many errors and one single charge: the euro.
Bearing in mind the initiatives I have described, I believe that there is now a solid basis on which we can develop the fishing and aquaculture sectors through innovative research in the context of the framework programme.
We are holding this debate in a far too technocratic way.
That is why I congratulate Mr Millán Mon on this excellent report, which comes at such an appropriate moment to strengthen relations between the two continents.
That is precisely why we have proposed a significant simplification of EU legislation.
Unfortunately, important amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have been rejected and, as a result, initiatives cannot be signed by EU residents who are not nationals of the Member States, thus eliminating equal participation by the residents, regardless of nationality, and there is no guarantee that the signatures will correspond to the designs of signatories.
I call for the creation of an independent committee composed of local and international legal experts to carry out investigations and prosecutions of the violent events that took place following the falsified elections in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West depends, to a large extent, on the results of Afghanistan.
This has gone too far and must be stopped.
The development of a guide for public and private operators and the creation of a training and mobility system on how to implement multi-level governance policies could be effective measures to improve regional policy.
I also hope that our Spanish and Italian colleagues will join us, but this problem cannot wait any longer, because the whole world is young after the innovation market.
Furthermore, I believe that we have an obligation to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies, starting with the next reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), are adequately complied with these requirements.
Mr President, the negotiations under way for a new EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties.
Without prejudice to the adoption of important measures proposed in this report, I would like to draw attention here to one essential element in this issue.
However, this will not expose the economy and jobs to bureaucracy, unfair competition or unforeseen price variations.
This will not have a negative impact on cod stocks because there are currently very few by-catches of cod.
The proposed sanctions are proportionate and necessary, and it is to be hoped they will discourage unfair commercial behaviour adopted by commercial operators.
In my opinion, this criterion is irrational and discriminatory given that, as in the case of Portugal, the majority of these families live in homes in rural areas.
This is a measure of poverty that is being measured in absolutely and purely financial terms and which does not take into account the diversity of the 27 Member States; its argument can be summarised as one of simple solvency.
Therefore, both ODA resources and new funding will be necessary.
The ethical audit of the work of this project has produced a positive outcome, which has been certified.
In my opinion, the level of 75% cofinancing now proposed is too high.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify two points.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for paying attention to the issue of Tunisia.
The rapporteur above all regrets the fact that citizens are not aware of the rights that would have been granted to them.
Although the creation of an area of security, justice and freedom within the European Union is vital to all of us, and is, of course, a model of European democracy that we are building, and even though many of us consider Europol to be an instrument that can be adapted, yet we attach great importance to the accumulation of resources - especially human resources, as well as technical resources in the fight against organised crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking - as being strictly controlled by our citizens, with legal guarantees that we should be targeted.
That is why it is essential to adopt all measures that could strengthen the guarantee of transparency and independence of impact assessments, since this will help maximise the role of this instrument as a support for decision making and as a guarantee of the quality and usefulness of the activities carried out by the EU institutions.
My second point is that the strategy should enhance the internal cohesion of the EU, in other words, its convergence.
I would add that this is not the direction that the Commission was taking, since its proposal focuses - with the regulation adopted by this Parliament - on reforming the current system of agencies, which are private, and on very rigorous strengthening of transparency requirements in order to avoid conflicts of interest, honesty in their credit rating work.
The European Commission is also asked to assess the costs and benefits of creating a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation.
Even before the crisis we are facing today, the Member States of the European Union have already experienced social problems arising from weak economic growth, a complicated demographic situation and difficulties in living in an increasingly globalised world economy.
There are, however, some concerns about the danger of decreasing the enthusiasm of Moldovans.
We in this House have always adopted a strong conduct in defence of the autonomous rights of those of Tibet, which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence.
Although a directive will be approved shortly, we have voted along with the other Members on a resolution setting out the direction to be taken in Parliament on this issue.
In this context, it is important to introduce a system for monitoring and verifying medicines, which will give patients reliable information.
It is worth fighting for these things, and I intend to do so.
These costs will, however, admit a number of exceptions if the Member State asking them for a solid reason in this regard.
This framework decision should not result in unjustified bureaucracy where more appropriate options are available for the issues dealt with.
The Bank has not foreseen that a major crisis is being approached and has not even gone into the regulation, which is far from perfect.
However, as a serious organisation, the European Union should be better prepared for such situations and should, above all, be prepared to react effectively in cases of emergency.
- Report: Kaczmarek
We should therefore support its inclusion only if these measures are not effective.
I am committed to informing the European institutions about this civil protest.
The EU and the industrialised countries should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of between 25% and 40% by 2020 and, in the long term, to try to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 values.
Report: Maria do Céu Patrão Neves
I would like to address two important issues that have been raised several times during this debate.
First of all, on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for cooperation and the spirit of compromise, which has enabled us to reach an agreement within the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of European passengers travelling by bus and coach, in particular, as regards disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility.
One of the reasons for this would be the fragmented defence equipment market.
Since the very beginning of this period, the subject of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy forms has been an important point.
The creation of the EEAS will require a variety of decisions, perhaps including changes to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations, both of which require a Commission proposal and adoption under the codecision procedure.
We fully support the development of civil capabilities in order to create an appropriate balance between resources.
in writing. - The situation in the whole of North Africa is indeed dangerous, but is also very hopeful.
Coordination requires continuous improvement, and the responsibility of the Member States in this area should certainly be increased.
With their very strong vote, the people of Ireland are offering us enthusiasm and strength to continue to thrive and build a strong and, above all, federal Europe.
While environmental protection and safeguarding of public health are intrinsically linked, I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers.
It is a dilemma that we have to solve together.
We must cooperate with large consumers, such as the US, China, Russia and Japan, to solve this problem and create a global system for the warning and registration of illegal logging and countries that raise problems, with the help of the Interpol, a UN body using the last generation of satellite technology.
Of course, we cannot allow short-term support to undermine industry's competitiveness in the long term.
I would like to say that this is a report based on the principle of subsidiarity.
As a result of the effects of the current economic and social crisis, the fight against unemployment and social exclusion has drawn particular attention to the European public and the European institutions.
This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.
Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to say that, in my opinion, this subject is far too important for us to continue to live in the lies in which we live in Europe.
Of course, as has been pointed out, we did not know the names of the candidates, and we did not have a female candidate, although, to be fair to Commissioner Barnier, he did not explain this properly.
We deplore the abstentions rate in the European elections and negative votes in referendums.
We will have to ask what is happening and we will communicate to you, Mr Coelho.
(PL) Mr President, horizontal agreements cover a variety of regulations and the falls in legislative, deliberate or non-competitive articles may lead to competition being removed.
We also need a common European asylum system that is more efficient and protective.
That concludes Question Time.
I am also aware that you are all keen to be involved in a form of police cooperation, which respects human rights and devotes attention to the values of the European Union.
Picasso has drawn up the same horrors in his camp Guernica, representing our town of Guernica totally destroyed by Junkors in Condor Law seven decades ago.
In this respect, it is also the case that speculators are attempting to speculate against a weak economic situation, and so sometimes they are making it worse.
Mr Bové is very right, and Mr Fajmon is very right...
We must promote not only the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local distribution, which ensure the diversity of agriculture throughout Europe.
The Rapkay report on the modification of the Staff Regulations in the context of the establishment of the European External Action Service, the EEAS, is a very important document on the road to creating an EU external policy.
We therefore believe and will debate this again at first reading, that initial expenditure reflects this priority, and we agree with the emphasis put by the rapporteur on multilingualism and the property sector, which we have always prioritised, but on the emphasis on the legislation.
A few weeks ago, I had the honour of leading a delegation from the Committee on International Trade of this Parliament, which attended the Seventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.
With this in mind, Europe will be able to make progress at the top.
We have asked the Member States to put forward names, including women.
Firstly, it is essential to maintain a geographical distribution of the financial aid granted from the EU budget in favour of Mediterranean and Eastern European countries, in accordance with the provisions of the 2007-2013 financial perspective and to continue to support these countries in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank.
We believe that the situation in Kosovo is an exceptional state, and I would like to recall that it has not been recognised by Spain, nor by four other Member States.
These are the reasons enough not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU Summit in response to the appeals of the Belarusian opposition.
It is a very important approach to indicate the real humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market.
Mr President, I wish to support the assaults of my fellow Members on the rights of disabled travellers, what Mrs Kadenbach has said about children, the issue of protection against fires in hotels and, in particular, the safety of people in all European Union hotels and the need to create a new proposal that is pertinent to the future.
I, too, intended to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission, so I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on his appointment.
It is clear from the report that the Member States are the only ones that have national defence and security authority, which we believe we must emphasise.
Similarly, the Member States are most concerned about asset stripping and secret takeovers were the ones without the confidentiality thresholds about participating and without any disclosure of information in the case of differentiation contracts.
I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Lehne, for his approach.
In other words, the Copenhagen Accord contains references to the level of ambition needed to address climate change for the post-2012 climate agreement and lays the foundation for a financial package and calls for serious commitments to reduce emissions.
AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis still take up four million lives each year.
From a purely commercial point of view, I call on the Commission to ensure that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) cannot be used to prevent the sale of medicines at more competitive prices; I mean safe generic medicines, which do not violate copyright and which alone blame are products in emerging countries such as India and Brazil, and that they can attack Western pharmaceutical industries.
After all, Members have the right to say what they want.
This is unacceptable.
We want to get involved.
That is why we will have to find the right level of financial and technological compensation.
Here, too, we can take more robust action in competition protection policy and in consumer protection.
It is also a disgrace that these politicians are asking us to accept the outcome of the second referendum when they have not actually accepted the result of the first.
As co-author of the motion for a European Parliament resolution on Kyrgyzstan, I would like to express my thanks to my fellow Members who today voted in favour of this document.
I will conclude, Mr President, Minister, with a suggestion for future generations.
It is absolutely crucial to establish clear rules and objectives for managing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in order to sustainably strengthen the internal market and improve the quality of the environment in the European Union, as well as recover strategic raw materials.
The Heads of State or Government have also emphasised that nuclear safety must not be limited to European Union territory and that we will also ask our neighbours to carry out these stress tests.
A very clear distinction must be maintained between military and humanitarian bodies' missions, and a dialogue between military and humanitarian bodies is needed to encourage mutual understanding.
The Commission is currently working to create a more systematic assessment of the development of the quality of public finances, including issues of creating the budget by reporting on performance.
This will be a priority for me, as Trade Commissioner.
Therefore, the Commission could submit new amendments or proposals depending on the situation.
The United States has remained in debt of introducing clear and transparent visa refusal criteria in some Member States.
Only the issue of financing remains open.
For others in this House, there is a need for constructive criticism of Turkey, and we are friends and take a critical stance.
Studies have shown that the profits made from trafficking in human beings go beyond those carried out by smuggling and drug trafficking.
Farmers in my area feel deeply disappointed and even insulted by the fact that there are assumptions here that they would not know what they are doing and that they would need to be told what they are doing.
No.
That is why I voted in favour of this resolution; taking account of the negative impact of the liberalisation of markets on local economies, it underlines the strategic importance of reasonable tariff protection.
In general, I voted in favour of the proposals presented in this report which aim to redress the European economy by providing greater financial assistance to projects in the field of energy.
The way in which the report on the European Refugee Fund calls for refugee resettlement in the EU makes this report even more incomprehensible.
This is an estimated increase.
Economists use mathematical models to highlight the value of domestic activities.
Only when we are fully informed of such cases will we be able to discuss the relevant monitoring of the application of Community law.
I repeat: under no circumstances.
I also insist that, in particular, in the run-up to the Copenhagen conference, the EU and other international players define their policies on international trade, climate change, humanitarian aid and development.
In relation to a statement by Commissioner Rehn, who I very much respect, and who said that Nigeria is a very poor country, I have to contradict it: it is not true, Nigeria is a very wealthy country, but it is a corrupt and incapable class that has been pitting the country's resources, leaving millions of citizens in poverty.
Finally, Mr Mölzer, I would urge you not to be so pessimistic, Mr Mölzer.
I therefore ask the Council to declare without delay its position on Parliament's new proposal for ACP countries to be able to benefit from the measures announced for 2010, and I ask the Commission to ensure that social and environmental requirements are respected by non-ACP producers and exporters.
That is why the Commission - as the coordinator of the Energy Community - must focus on Ukraine and remember its obligations with regard to the security of Europe's supply.
in writing. - We regret, indeed the victims of all authoritarian and aggressive regimes, regardless of the atrocities that have been committed in Europe or, for example, in the former European colonies.
The regulation should be aimed mainly not at imposing a bureaucratic and expensive process for checking each product, but at implementing a new common control and responsibility culture.
Member of the Commission. - The current EU competition policy towards vertical agreements strongly supports Internet sales, and I am sure you are aware of that, Mr President.
On the other hand, the report contains clear recommendations on the second and third mistake, and all this leads us in the right direction.
With regard to transport, much more needs to be done to apply restrictions to those producing vehicles in order for them to create more fuel-efficient vehicles.
The financial situation in certain countries in the euro area, which has been analysed today, clearly shows the risks which are caused by removing the agreements in the Stability and Growth Pact.
I therefore think it would be very sensible to consider how we could best use the financial resources saved in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new, exclusively and necessary financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives.
The Commission, but also Parliament, have deliberately decided not to raise the issue of fund processing at all, because we are working on the assumption that the sector will keep to its promise to deal with this issue autonomously, without legislative pressure.
That brings me to the two questions concerning the Europe 2020 strategy.
(EL) Madam President, with regard to the manufacturing industry, I should like to recall in this House that Pakistan is the fourth, as a importance, between the cotton producers in the world, representing 9% of global production, followed by the European Union just under 5.5%.
In this case, the Council and, above all, this Parliament, are also involved in deciding on the composition of the College and on the portfolios that you will make available, as well as on the programme for the next five years that you will be presenting.
We have to understand that the structures have only been in place for a year and that we should move on to the next stage in 2009.
This is, of course, reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people, because the country has already gone into recession, and living conditions are being tightened up for workers and people, are exacerbating inequality, and poverty is also increasing.
These objectives, President of the Commission and President of the Commission, have already been formulated within the framework of the 2020 objectives.
We are already negotiating, with many Arab countries, initiatives to obtain gas, hopefully for a Nabucco pipeline through Turkish transit.
Therefore, taking steps towards its total eradication is a goal of health policy, to which governments can best contribute by doing so, showing flexibility.
As this is my last intervention in this House, I would like to thank you, all colleagues and staff, for your cooperation.
I am aware that there are currently major differences between the electoral rules of the various Member States.
It seems that many generalists are beginning too late with the treatment of anti-dementia drugs in order not to overcome their budgets, and that is counterproductive.
Paradoxically, it is an instrument that can be abused very easily in practice and not only by extremists, but also by very strong and strong interest groups, and I say this because we believe that a threshold of 1 000 claims of support is not a great prey to the demographic potential of the Union.
The 2010 budget establishes this systematic approach.
According to the report from the UN working group, victims of trafficking come from different social backgrounds, from the ralthiest to the poorest, from the most educated to the completely illiterate, from the early age to older women.
President-in-Office of the Council. - This is indeed a very important question.
We need greater and better European economic governance for national action to support this orientation, including the financial transaction tax that the Commission has to look very closely, including in a European context.
I believe that the mutual recognition of medical prescriptions between Member States is very important because this is not only about healthcare, but also about post-treatment; however, we have a time when this detail can be put on the table.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports, which raise important issues regarding the contribution of the European Union's trade policy to achieving some of the fundamental objectives of public policy: respect for human rights, the pursuit of economic well-being and social justice, the achievement of sustainable growth and respect for the environment and, above all, the climate system.
Consumers will be able to resort to a series of remedies if they purchase a product that is not in line with the contract and will be entitled to claim harm if the situation is not remedied.
Mr President, the reason for the urgency is the brutal murder of 57 people, accompanying a politician who would be a candidate for elections as provincial governor.
This new smart symmetric system will lead to more rigorous supervision by the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank, which are more complete, as well as the formulation of recommendations for additional reforms and correction plans.
The Syrian people deserve the long-awaited political reforms, especially with regard to freedom of expression, assembly, political participation and governance.
Many of them were UK citizens, trafficked in the UK, and not for export, if you will allow me this wording.
(FR) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has returned to economic growth in the third quarter of 2009, which makes us believe that the worst has come to an end.
In this context, it is expected that Greece will adopt a global programme of structural reforms aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the public administration, enhancing pension reform and healthcare, improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the system for negotiating wages, enhancing the functioning of the product market and business, and maintaining the stability of the financial and banking sector.
We still consider it essential that, when agreements are established between sovereign countries, the following reference be made to the following: respect for the sovereignty of a country and its people, of mutual interests, of reciprocity and of cooperation, taking into account the specificities of each country; the assessment of what each could bring to the agreement within the economic, social and cultural terms.
I believe that the transition to a sustainable and green economy will move forward and without imposing excessive legislative provisions.
It seems that everyone is looking at the contribution of the US and NATO, of course, to securing peace in Europe.
I think we should take this as an opportunity to address what Europe really needs: economic development, employment, a dynamic sector of small businesses, more innovation, more effective public procurement - that is what our citizens will be doing.
I think it is not our job to predict the possible development of these countries.
The second project involves concessions.
Madam President, during the European elections in 2004, Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace, so I met numerous irritated constituents outside restaurants and public institutions.
In fact, at a time of deep breakdown in state actions, the increase in EU budgets is an act of confidence in the common project and the strengthening of action taken at supranational level.
I know that the message is a good one, so what we are spreading it.
This report contains rules regarding the analysis of air transport agreements in terms of content and procedures to be adopted.
The language law creates an imbalance.
Perhaps, after the Treaty of Lisbon finally comes into force on 1 December, it can be left out of the discussions in this House and the British internal policy debate.
This is the difference between the reality of the situation and the irremarkable dreams of the European Parliament.
Furthermore, we support the need for every national parliament to be fully involved, in accordance with their budgetary and control rights, in order to increase transparency, ownership and the responsibility for decisions taken, including at European level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, five plus two questions have been asked on economic governance and the Europe 2020 strategy.
This is why I believe that we should have an active involvement, both by national authorities and by the European Commission and by Members of this Parliament, in promoting SOLVIT.
It is a system based on real policies and guidelines, and now, Mr Michel, some protagonists and a liberal rhetoric that gave rise to the current situation: promoting an agri-industrial model, in keeping with protecting the interests of the large agri-food industries and the resulting impoverishment of the world's agricultural sector; and years of inappropriate investment in agriculture, to promote the farming sector of 70% and the underwater sector.
Economically: the amount allocated to producers is lower than production costs, and the CAP must enable this problem to be resolved.
Once again, I urge the Commission, in its contact with the government, to insist on this promise until it is included in the Congo legislation.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand the great interest that Parliament has shown in action taken both inside and outside the Union to face the challenges faced by some Member States in public finances.
We sympathise with the desire of nations that want a better life, emancipation and a better day tomorrow.

You have all fought for this, whether you are alert or orange.
I believe that this procedure strengthens public food safety at EU level and also provides greater clarity for Member States and third countries which export meat products to the EU.
In view of this situation, it seems that it is unreasonable to respect the Mercosur Agreement, especially as the Swedish Institute for Food and Technology has drawn attention to the fact that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef may be 35 times higher than that of Irish beef.
Therefore, as agreed with the Council, the following text should be added to the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, which is Article 1, paragraph 2 (b) of the amendment regulation:'the same reference rate applies to the annual review of the value of tariffs regulated by Articles 4a, 4a, 4b) and Article 6a paragraph 3, when those currencies are expressed in those currencies'.
Today, the Irish Government has asked and rightly obtained European solidarity.
Take, for example, Ireland, a country that has been extremely hard hit by the financial crisis: its membership of monetary union has protected it from an even greater crisis of proportions.
It is afraid of German claims on Sudeten property and, having listened to German politicians talking about this subject, I think they are absolutely right to be afraid.
an increase in aid from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, as well as increased financial support for technical activities linked to the development and implementation of projects;
If we do not implement something that makes countries realise that there will be tough consequences if they conduct irrational economic policies, we will get nowhere.

In Russia, freedom of the press and of the media is indeed a problem.
Similarly, every Member State can decide to sign or ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which constitutes two major instruments introduced by the Council of Europe.
This is therefore a structured dialogue, which gives us the opportunity to change views on the issues that concern us.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, with people who are already receiving protection at work, and with some support to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and then have to go through the cycle of a new training and a new skilled year or two to keep a new job; to maintain existing jobs.
Madam President, our questions have been formulated with the aim of highlighting the benefits that our citizens can expect from such a package of measures and what we can provide in such a package.
I voted in favour of the report because it also adds some substantial improvements to the text of the European Commission, particularly with regard to the protection of individuals' data.
Furthermore, we have made an assessment of unused funds from 2009, so a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II could be used.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for the very clear message that you have sent us.
It can be seen to include them your communication, as well as to try to use the holistic approach, which failed even in the way we had imagined it would succeed, but it is still on the right track.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which has sometimes been rather difficult, and the Council, with which we tried to find reasonable solutions in the midnight sittings and in many trialogue sittings, because only one hour ago, the Council approved and the reasonable compromise reached.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, set up the European coordination unit for aviation in the event of a crisis following the meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010.
At the same time, it is important to remember that rarely the problem itself, in this case illegal logging, creates the conditions for the trade in illegal timber.
I come from a country, Portugal and a region, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and is an essential component of these regions which, from a social point of view, are rather fragile and in which it would, in fact, be vital to maintain the quota system after 2015.
People are not the product of different cultures; different cultures are the product of different peoples.
In certain cases, these suggestions are really so good that they must be taken into account.

Mr President, Members have an important role to play in examining decisions on health claims.
For this reason, we are saying a definite'yes' to the Nabucco project, but it is also our decision to support the efforts made by our governments to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the well-being of our populations.
Political parties can be banned; there is corruption in the legal system; there is abuse of human rights; freedom of expression and association does not exist as in countries such as Britain or most European states.
It is also quite clear that we need an energy mix composed of different sources and set as high as possible, because this will stabilise the situation in the sector and, as a result, the diversity of each nation and Europe will be restored.
However, I have certain doubts when Parliament instigates international law to condemn certain disagreeable practices, as the legal basis for this is far from clear.
With the vote on this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I clearly express my full support for the Tunisian people and the historic democratic revolution that it began.
Furthermore, it urges Member States to take appropriate measures and effective policies, such as national action plans or social measures aimed at reducing energy poverty, and to regularly report on the actions undertaken to solve this problem.
If it hinders the passing of a law through the Hungarian Parliament and decrees that, from now on, only by a two-thirds majority can be amended, you know that it will not be easy to change again after the next elections.
Generalised tariff preferences (debate)
Today in plenary, we voted on the recommendation for harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
The subject of a new sense of mutual trust brings us to another major issue.
This year, we have allocated EUR 9.5 million more to the EEAS, but we will be able to assess the real costs after the first year in operation, when a report on all the expenses related to the work of the EEAS will be presented to the European Parliament.
My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability, as we all know, is a factor in the crisis in the entire region and also for Afghanistan.
Of course, we cannot overlook the biological differences between men and women.
Let us not forget these factors, including with regard to the proposal to allocate revenue from infrastructure fees.
(HU) Mr President, what I welcome in this directive is the clearer definition of patients' rights, the end of the waiting lists and the proposed solution to the problem of a lack of specialists in their own country.
Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, if I may, I would like to make a few direct comments on the issues and questions that have been raised.
In committee last week, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a ghost Presidency.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the continued violations of human rights here, particularly with regard to the freedom of association, expression and information, and because I support the democratic wishes of the Iranian people.
In particular, rapid initial funding will be very important.
We must not confine ourselves solely to creating such a mechanism, and it must also be accessible and understandable to EU citizens, to allow them to make full use of it.
The agreement will not only increase the competitiveness of European and Canadian markets, but will also increase their safety, given that regulators and enforcement authorities will increasingly focus on cooperation in all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement, in order to ensure the highest possible level of safety in both passenger and freight transport.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).
Moreover, the private aspect not only improves the image that Europe presents in the world, but also promotes European citizenship.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing today is intended to amend the regulations approved in 2004 that improved and harmonised the security regulations on the protection of passports and travel documents of European Union citizens against fraudulent use, while at the same time introducing biometric identification elements.
Secondly, a kind of temporary institutional framework must be created for the decision-making mechanism.
That being said, on a positive note, part of the agreements that we have had recently are very good, for example, the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why it is important for Parliament to return to the Commission's attention the social clause that is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade realises that the current constructive cooperation approach with the European Union is far more effective than trying to rewrite history all the time.
It may seem amusing, but the European Commission did not find either the arguments or the time needed to get the Latvian Government to end the discrimination on linguistic grounds.
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to provide all possible help to the Pakistani Government to urgently abolish this extremely damaging discrimination against religious minorities in this country.
This will be an effective tool to stop illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for it.
Of course, more than ever, we need financial institutions to take a halt and re-evaluate their approach.
Our common objective, agreed in committee, is to minimise by-catches and discards.
The main aim of the aid to trade is to increase the internal and international competitiveness of the 48 states.
Even if we accepted the argument of internalising external costs as a good starting point, it is, after all, inconceivable that only heavy goods vehicles should be punished and not ordinary vehicles, in order to mitigate congestion, as the old'polluter pays' principle applies in a clearly discriminatory way.
I was encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this debate in plenary.
Moreover, when you look at the starting point, we have some concerns.
The main objective of the European Union and the governments of the Member States, whether centre or centre left, is to protect the continued profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes between the territory of the European Union.
Thus, action must be taken to propagate good practice and raise awareness of the local decision-making powers about the benefits the ICT sector has to offer.
Mr President, I could not hear the English interpretation of the previous speech.
However, before this recast, this codification, there is a very important aspect to the whole restructuring of the TEN-T networks over the next ten years.
(LT) Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is essential for the Ukrainian people, but let us not forget, however, that it is also very important for the citizens of the European Union, because Ukraine is an important partner for us, especially in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe.
This is why the Commission must have a resounding voice.
We cannot interfere in a problem where only the US Government has the competence to do so.
Silingual growers are no longer remunerated any less for securing these hidden functions, which we consider to be automatic.

With regard to Mr Salafranca's valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission, which are now both represented by Baroness Ashton, to take urgent action in three directions.
There are large dealers, with a strong market presence in some Member States, and there are also many small dealers who are more satisfied with what we are now proposing than the provisions in force since 2002, because they have found that certain aspects, unintended by the legislator in 2002, were not in their interest, but have created difficulties in coping with the competition of large distributors.
It must build the'EU regional political partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', which was launched by the Committee on Development, when adopting its report in April 2007.
In those years, especially after the historic enlargement of 2004, the context and ambitions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) have changed considerably.
Spain takes up the luxury of the Presidency of the European Union immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
In this respect, we must ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is brought into line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and falls within the priority actions of the Single Market Act.

The whole of healthcare, regardless of the specific characteristics, falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union.
However, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that a recent study by the European Cardiology Society has demonstrated once again that there are serious limitations on this methodology as a result of the low levels of participation by women in such studies.
The fact is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, nor should they prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives.
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the recovery of organic waste, especially in this region mainly agricultural, to verify the data and for an exchange system of best practices to be established.
There is an illogical law which says that priests, episoes and Orthodox patriarchates must be Turkish citizens.
The most important element of the position taken by Parliament is the focus on the deterrent measures which can therefore be inconsistent, not only as a legislative text, but especially as regards implementation.
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is ensured.
At least the digital single market has succeeded in becoming one of the EU's priorities.
This would be an important step forward towards transparency, openness and clarity in the European process.
(DE) Mr President, I support the PPE Group's proposal, which is perfectly logical for us to discuss this issue.
Is this model of economic development that Europe should propose to the people of Europe?
Generally speaking time does not allow speakers to exceed their speaking time, but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela's statement was particularly important to us.
We want a real strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment, a strategy which, once implemented, will ultimately lead to improved quality of life for all European citizens in the Danube region.
This is indeed a great achievement given that, without entering into matters related to the legal basis, this directive recognises patients' undisputed rights and opens up a new range of possibilities for accessing better treatment.
Year after year, the Court of Auditors was unable to ensure that the EU budget was legally and appropriately spent and we were really concerned about the lack of control over taxpayers' money when we were accountable to the European Commission in 2002.
It is a huge challenge and a great honour for me.
If we are fair, we must acknowledge our historic responsibility for climate change, and we must recognise that our emissions per capita are still several times higher than those in China or India, for example.
I am convinced that this dialogue will be constructive.
We therefore regret the fact that, as with Europol, the rush to interrupt the desire to guarantee fundamental freedoms.
I agree with the Commission's proposal, which aims to introduce a simpler additional method for using ESF reserves to ensure a more rapid and effective response to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing.
Frankly, I should have voted against the proposed Commission, but together with the weak candidates there were also some very good candidates - including the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
President of the Commission. - You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but in addition to the UK, there are 26 Member States still in the European Union, so you will understand that, although we are very sensitive to the concerns that you have expressed, I have to listen to other concerns just.
I believe that we must be careful to maintain the neutrality of the EU's humanitarian response, even though it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas.
Furthermore, it adds new points to what Parliament has already said in the past, asking, for example, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of investigations by all parties and to report to Parliament, recalls that the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States need to monitor the investigations fully and express concern themselves with the pressure on the NGOs involved in the drafting of the Goldstone report and including the follow-up measures required for the activities.
I also hope that this decision will help prevent the disappearance of fish species.
I hope you will interpret my question not as a challenge, but as a help in the way of reflection.
I am always willing - and, I hope, able - to come back to explain the results achieved, but we need to check the findings we make.
This result will strengthen the EU's negotiating position in international trade talks, especially in the Doha negotiations under way in the World Trade Organisation.
When Europe speaks with one voice, the United States of America will adopt the same objective.
For this reason, I support the prices set for tobacco growers in Europe, at least as long as people are still smoking in Europe.
If we look at the initiatives of the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries have taken the issue more seriously than others.
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) that is separate from European structural policy.
The number of new infections continues to exceed the number of those who acquire access to treatment, two thirds of those in need of treatment not benefiting from it in 2009, which means that 10 million people have not had access to the efficient treatment they needed.
In fact, when the person's dignity is valued, we do not see minorities in a negative way.
I welcome the Commission's proposals to simplify this fund.
All EU institutions must ensure in the future that our budgets serve to help citizens and businesses to overcome economic times and make recovery plans.
The quickest way to sell them, more efficiently and more practical than all the hierarchic measures, is to support civic initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions.
To all those who are still fighting against this treaty with false conviction that it is a treaty that reinforces the European Union, I say this: those who are fighting against this treaty are, in fact, making our so-called partners stronger or, if you like, opponents.
The European Union's acceptance of global capitalism is an acceptance that will stifle us all.
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting where the Commission will encourage the development of a network comprising other means of transport.

The first person to ask for the floor this morning was Mr Madlener.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.

Indeed, I would remind the House that, on the basis of recent harassment, there are more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union - perhaps 25 million unemployed - which means attracting more asylum seekers is actually a kind of collective suicide.
The Commission must impose sanctions, not the finance ministers.
In order to recover economically, Sri Lanka depends on direct foreign investment and EU economic support.

The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 on specific measures for agriculture in favour of the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.

There are some countries that do not make full use of the European Structural Funds allocated to them, with 30 or 40% remaining unspent.
Although the Commission has said that it has information and publishes them, that there is an obligation to publish it, this situation makes me wonder why, for example, this has not been known.
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I strongly support the proposal to launch an effective information campaign that increases the visibility of the points of single contact.
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and that it wants to make the implementation of economic policy objectives binding.
I voted today in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation on unitary patent protection because I believe that the blockade reached in the Council was unjustified due to linguistic arrangements.

What makes me a little suspicious, Commissioner, is the considerable influence of the CARS 21 group and this industry on the process which is started here.
We disagree with that.

Of course, we cannot understand how it is possible for the illegal worker to take up a job, and the person who has committed him and who covers the cost of residence and life is punished.
I believe that the measuring system based on corbuilding different study parameters will lead to more political decisions that are suited to the needs of society and the economy in general.

Finally, High Representative, you will go to the Middle East.
Worse still, the US Congress changed by adopting the US militants' Act one month after the International Criminal Court was established in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would briefly like to explain to you that this report includes the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, following the resolution adopted in plenary on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission's proposal for the authorisation of the marketing of poultrymeat intended for human consumption, even after it was the subject of antimicrobian treatment.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my condolences for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, as well as my deep concern for the other four Cuban prisoners and an opposition activist who have also begun a hunger strike in protest.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 2010-2014 Multiannual Programme on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Stockholm Programme).
Our motto should not be wasted a single cent.
The European Union, especially the Mediterranean countries, has always been at the forefront in terms of humanitarian aid to the Saharawi people, because the principle of solidarity towards people living in such problematic conditions is fundamental.
It is invisible; it is often the case that the workers are themselves isolated, with access to the trade unions being very difficult in such situations.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, first of all I must thank the two Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today.
However, in its current form, and although some of the amendments contributed to improving it, Mrs Guillaume's report is a real incentive for people to abuse this process, blocking the relevant services and depriving those who really need a rapid review of their case.
It is time and our responsibility to do everything we can, and I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their excellent work, which uses us all.
We have completed a truly huge programme that has encompassed some major, important reports.
The so-called'dumping' phenomenon poses a major threat to workers, fundamentally undermining their rights.
The Commission and the Council must intensify their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, I should like to ask, in relation to what the Commissioner has said on the evaluation of each proposal, whether an ex-ante study can be carried out on the subject, including on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the specificities of the area, so that there are criteria that each country takes into account and respects in the project.
We also need to take into account Roma women, who are facing particular problems in terms of poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence; also the problem for young Roma, due to their lack of qualifications, which makes access to employment even more difficult in these times of economic crisis.
in writing. - (PT) I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (EDF) in order to extend the scope of its interventions in the housing sector to help marginalised communities in all Member States.
It is also a matter of attention to all political decision makers within their scope of competence in that, in order to have real freedom of the press, public authorities do indeed have a role to play: they must be prepared to protect freedom of speech and encourage its development.
Mr President, I believe that the European Union has become far too large, has too many cultures, and I simply have no confidence in this system and will be worse and worse.
It is a little too early to announce the results of this analysis and, as the Member knows, every step in this process requires unanimity in the Council.
It is important to note that the EU's integration prospects are the strongest incentive for the Balkan countries to carry out the necessary reforms and also to maintain stability in the region.
Now that advertising has taken on an even greater role, it is essential to lay down criteria enabling consumers and patients to be fully aware and sure of the types of effects that these medicines have.
Having said this with the words of Neil Armstrong, it would be a small step for the European funds, but a huge leap for the European economy.
Thirdly, the security gaps that it was claimed would appear if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement simply do not exist.
In addition, the rapid spread of internality and e-commerce in recent years has resulted in an increase in the supply of electronic games and the subsequent emergence of cross-border issues that remain unresolved.
All those who take decisions in this area must have equal access to professional information on the country of origin of the applicant and authorised bodies to hear appeals.
I therefore appreciate, after all these years, what important step has been to create the only multinational parliament in the world elected by universal suffrage.
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion a year on defence, and this sum of EUR 200 billion needs to be better spent than in the past.
Together we have left something behind us.
Furthermore, during this parliamentary term, we will work on services of general interest.
So I would suggest that we invite, for example, Mr Almunia, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, to take the floor, since he was quite critical of some countries during his term of office, and then the problem with Greece.
In this respect, Turkey needs a huge need for reform.
The EGF has already been used in the past by other European Union countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, and now the time has come to provide this aid to Lithuania.
