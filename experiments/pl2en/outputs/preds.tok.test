Among these sides , I would like to mention , above all , the former President of the South Africa and the President of the African Union , Thabo Mbeki , and the mediation he has carried out , and I think it is important to emphasise the role played by our Special Representative in Sudan , Rosale Marsden , in mediation .
Thank you to the activists in the socio-economic environment , who have shown initiative , and thanks to which Parliament could clearly state to the Commission the need to establish European vessels for mutual societies , associations and foundations .

We have developed a common standard of the European Union in the area of minority rights , which was an absolute necessity .
The surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances and a shift of direction in the area of competition in the Member States of the EU connected with the euro area is particularly guaranteed due to higher economic and financial side-effects in the euro area ; less market discipline ; no threat to exchange rates and better alignment with potentially high costs for the euro area as a whole .
For my country and , in particular , for the citizens affected , it is important that the European Parliament approve this decision .
It is not enough simply to add the word &apos; solidarity &apos; by an amendment to make this European energy policy acceptable , as the same amendment prohibits the European Union from interfering in the market .
This is intended to eliminate the widespread practice in the railway sector of using national standards to block the approval of the recruitment already approved by other countries .
However , we can already say that racism and xenophobia are still widespread in the European Union and they affect the lives of members of ethnic minorities .

I would like to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and with all those who have suffered , and my support for the local authorities , to use this forum to appeal to the European Community because it must be said that such a situation requires a European response and , above all , European solidarity .

Unfortunately , it seems that the real aim is to rein hand and to attack our small and medium-sized enterprises .
I believe that the issue of geographical balance , which has so often been highlighted , could be resolved in a much better way .

This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a free trade agreement between the European Union and India .

MEPs said &apos; no &apos; to the flexible response and to &apos; no &apos; to the unacceptable pressure exerted by France to the main democratic body on the continent of Europe !
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the wake of the events in Afghanistan , we undoubtedly risk our credibility in the international community .

The &apos; new agreement &apos; environment , in other words , the new logic of economic organisations based on innovation in green technologies and supported by the international capital markets , will form the foundation of an increasing number of rescue and stimulus programmes , including in the Member States of the European Union .
Bilateral agreements between certain Member States on the implementation of projects such as &apos; Nord Stream &apos; lead to a lack of trust not only in environmental issues , but also in solidarity rules , which is why transparency is needed in this area .

However , it is important now that the Commission and the Member States play a strong game in Copenhagen .

As this is a disease where medicine costs are very high and the majority of patients are unable to cover them out of their own resources , more money is required for this .
Once again , on behalf of all of us , I would like to express our deepest sympathy to the victims and their families .
If this happens now , I sincerely hope that the perpetrators will be detected and arrested this time , otherwise there is a danger of further bloodshed , and this will be seen as a permission to commit such acts .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
We must call on regional and local authorities , as well as all the other stakeholders , to take advantage of this second chance .
The European Union must introduce budgetary control mechanisms , effective prevention and detection of fraud , so that public funds are made available only in cases where they are actually used properly , but bearing in mind effective penalties for those who violate the rules by seeking the illegal appropriation of these funds , which are by nature insufficient .
So I do not agree with Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s opinion that the entire package has only one dimension , which is reverse votes .

I believe that we have a currency that is strong and that is also historically sound .
This is the essence of everything we have to do in the country to ensure that the rule of law is actually functioning , based on the legal system , but also in the political and constitutional reform that is so important .
It is within this framework that the problem of operational needs and harmonisation of expenditure must be addressed by the European Parliament and the European Union .
We are aware of this .
This measure does not enable the products to be properly assessed prior to their marketing and ignores the threats posed by the sale of genetically modified organisms repeatedly .
You are right in saying that we need , above all , to prevent fire , and that is the main issue I would like to discuss .
The issue of whether drug abuse should be subject to criminal liability is a matter that is dealt with within the framework of the law of a Member State and the EU should not seek to disrupt the functioning of the justice system .

The European Union should intervene by taking legislative measures to ensure gender equality and to limit segregation in the labour market .

Mr President , in the context of today &apos;s discussion , I would like to draw attention to a controversial proposal for an amendment to Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure .
I would also remind you of the Global Working Pact of the World Trade Organisation , which proposes an adequate number of strategic options to enable us to emerge from the crisis .
Given the serious effects of bluetongue on livestock farming , all measures must be adopted to facilitate the use of good vaccination practices in order to protect farmers from the loss of animals , which can often cause tragic damage to these farms .

That is why I voted as I did .
That is what the second part of the European Economic Recovery Plan is about and , logically , support for the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Parliament has today voted in favour of blocking thrombin as an additive to food .
What happened to solidarity ?

We are not helping them by suggesting that they can escape this path ; they are not helped at all .
The key aspect of this initiative concerns the fundamental values of respect for cultural and linguistic diversity .
In my own country , Estonia , the fund has not yet been applied and , when I asked why , I heard that the conditions for using the fund are very strict and the restrictions that had so far been imposed on 1 000 people prevented from being applied .
I believe we will succeed together in establishing the fundamental principles that will facilitate future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , it is very worrying to increase the incidence of hate and aggressive attacks against Christians and their communities .

Another problem is the manipulation fee associated with outsourcing .
It is not a question of &apos; looking at &apos; in search of the possibility of existence and of creating a new Delaware in the European Union where businesses could evade this type of legislation .
Firstly , the 2011 EU budget sets priorities , which must be strengthened decisively in the light of the economic problems throughout Europe resulting from the structural crisis of recent years .

The accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant caused a huge disaster , together with the radioactive contamination of many people who were near the power plant and affected .
We need to evaluate and acquire a comprehensive overview of what has been achieved so far , their effects , possible shortcomings and what is happening , so that we can propose new and more considered measures .

The presence of the European Union in Kosovo is gradually materialising and the Union is taking over the United Nations tasks .

Today , we are concluding the task that we began 10 years ago , and to this day , I remember very well the indignation created by the Erika disaster in December 1999 - as Commissioner de Palacio put forward proposals quickly , the Council &apos;s cooperation , under pressure from the public , at least , has partly led to two packages ready by June 2002 , including my report on the monitoring and monitoring of European ships and monitoring of European vessels .

Greece will , of course , draw on cohesion funds as one of the countries that use these funds , but that is independent of the European Union 2020 strategy .

The role of the European Parliament is to speak .
in writing . - In 2008 , when I was a Latvian MEP , I tabled an amendment to the Criminal Code of the Republic of Latvia concerning increased responsibility for domestic violence against women and children .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
I welcome the fact that exemptions will not , in practice , be applied because there are safe alternatives that will prefer to select not only consumers but also professional users in the future .
Secondly , the use of construction materials such as asbestos must be avoided at all costs .
In other words , this debate was born out of the need for the precautionary measures , especially in the light of the lessons that we have all learnt from the Detroit case , which I have just mentioned .
Finally , I would like to emphasise the development of maritime corridors in particular and the request made by Greece last summer for the creation of a transport observatory in the Eastern Mediterranean in Greece .
The mere fact that the Chilean / African Development Fund grants EUR 2 billion to Africa can serve as a lectuary to EU countries .
The interpretation of articles of the Treaty seems to depend on which the wind is blowing .
I support this report , which will also allow Romania to access funds to speed up the integration of marginalised groups into the general public , including the Roma , both in urban and rural areas .
I would stress , however , that we are talking about international waters and that Lene Espersen , the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs , has firmly stated that this is unacceptable .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
I had hoped that in this part-session , Parliament would approve the appointment of José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission for the next five years .
Council and Commission statements on an instrument for medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments .
At the same time , however , the state has been deprived of specialists in the area of healthcare , most of which are Bulgarians .
The interests of large capital , economic and financial capital , and the major powers always stand up for the interests of solidarity .
The Czech authorities , including the President , have every right to say and to do what they like , but they must not forget that they are part of the European Union and are now speaking on behalf of almost 500 million citizens and 27 Member States .
This leads to financial problems , drastic reductions in investment opportunities and loss of competitiveness , especially for SMEs .
In conclusion , we believe that the instrument of pre-accession assistance is a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising financial assistance to candidate countries and potential candidate countries .
In the meantime , we should impose sanctions on assets freezing and on travel bans .
We are familiar with these practices , and our proposals are in a concrete way to prevent such disguised advertising from occurring in a number of different holes .
Once again this year , Russia is in danger of interrupting gas supplies , and there are indications that in future , we will have to prepare for such a eventuality in every winter .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for being prepared to make some compromises at the last minute .
Mr President , I am pleased that President Obama has decided to attend the EU-US Summit in Lisbon this month , and I have voted in favour of the resolution today .
The arrest of hundreds of thousands of people by the authorities , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political persecution , executions are contrary to the commitments of the People &apos;s Republic of China as a member of the United Nations .
This does not convince anyone , because this arrest was one of the hundreds of other who suffered opposition figures as part of the systematic suppression of any dissent .
There is no logic in this .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current difficult economic and financial scenario , Europe must continue to support projects in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector for a sustainable and social economy .
I consider the debate on the Single Market and the Services Directive to be extremely interesting , as well as their links to patients &apos; rights .

As has been stated in the last conclusions of the Human Rights Council , these high-level visits should always be discussed , and some of these visits should , if necessary , be met with a peaceful , democratic opposition .
However , the Kozloduy was just an example of the fact that the old reactors can be safe and well served .
As far as the Danish Government &apos;s plan for controls at the Danish internal borders is concerned , as Mrs Koppa mentioned , you probably know that the President of the Commission has immediately sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Denmark saying that the Commission &apos;s first analysis of whether the measures proposed are in line with the obligations of European and international law .
As the guardian of the EU Treaty , the European Commission must ensure that all Member States comply with the provisions of the regulation and provide promptly with all the necessary information on the planned development of energy infrastructure .
It is a very clear signal from the European institutions that European citizens do not accept the brutal treatment and killing of animals .

I am of the opinion that the human rights dialogue between the European Union and Russia should ask whether the indigenous people of the Arctic living in the Russian Federation are sufficiently involved in the work of the Arctic Council .
In this ruling , the Court made several comments relating to improving the listing procedures applied by the UN Sanctions Committee on al-Qaeda and the Taliban .
That is what I would like to thank my fellow Members who have contributed to this as shadow rapporteur , the rapporteur and others .
At a time when the economic situation of certain countries , such as Greece , is undermining the euro , the will and determination shown by Mario Draghi to lead the hard course towards a strong currency are indispensable in ensuring the credibility of our economy .
Discrimination in terms of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation is unacceptable in European society .
The first is that we must reach a legally binding agreement .
We had , in a way , a premiracle of this by adopting a regulation on hedge funds in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council ( Ecofin ) yesterday .
Welcome
I voted in favour of the report because money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund goes to workers made redundant .
One element of this policy must be to ensure that the EU is able to respond to any emergency crisis in oil supply .
The aim of this assistance is to improve the living conditions of the populations of the recipients through recommendations and to provide the instruments to ensure that these countries embark on the road to growth and responsibility .
Therefore , the solution for the future must be to take much better action , and another opportunity will be for the conference in Mexico this year .
That is the reality .
The blasphemy law on which death can be sentenced is incompatible with the universal values that we want to promote in our relations with Pakistan .
I supported the adoption of the European Parliament resolution calling , in particular , for Member States to take action to facilitate the deterioration of the disease of sufferers , such as promoting a healthy lifestyle , or ensuring that medicines are accessible to all those who need them , setting up specialist centres , ensuring adequate medical equipment throughout the country and drafting detailed strategic action plans for research in this area .
There is no stability without solidarity .
23 000 immigrants arrived in Italy from January .
Thanks to the Maltese Convention , Yemen &apos;s refugee service and many other Christian organisations can recognise that they are obliged to take care of the fate of refugees .
Therefore , next week &apos;s summit in Stockholm in Stockholm , as has already been mentioned , we will focus on areas of common interest such as climate change and energy and the global economic crisis .

Madam President , we have voted today on the review of the Green Paper on the future of the TEN-T policy .
As a member of the STOA team , set up with a view to making the management of natural resources more efficient , I believe that it is very important to develop a sound statistical database .
Last but not least , I would like to refer to the link between international trade and climate change .
in writing . - This report proposes a number of measures , some of which could improve the situation of small businesses , but their global effect is to increase EU control , the movements of the population , feminist agendas and the infiltration of companies by EU officials &apos; on professional experience &apos; .
This is intended to exclude the crisis , which is obvious to everyone , and which we have discussed many times .
The close relationship between public finances and the financial and economic crisis is very clear .
During this period , 189-member states of the UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality , some progress has been made in all 12 areas set out in the document .
Enlargement strategy for 2009 on the countries of the Western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey ( debate )
All participants should use the brick phade of the opportunities created by the Geneva negotiations .
I understand the value of the illegal cigarette trade smuggling into the EU is estimated at EUR 9.5 billion , with 97 % of the smuggling being detected .

Bulgaria and Romania have met the criteria and I congratulate Mr Coelho on linking the freedom of movement to citizens &apos; security in this balanced report , which was adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We are setting up tasks , but let us remember that the fight against the crisis takes precedence in funding .
However , do you think that the European Union is actually cutting red tape , as you say ?
They have come to Brussels to tell Parliament that if we adopt the proposed legislation on alternative investment , then we will have two thirds to finance their organisations .
The key Slovaks will undoubtedly prove to be &apos; added value &apos; , &apos; cohesion &apos; , &apos; flexibility &apos; and &apos; simpler &apos; .
There are , of course , other measures to get out of the crisis , but I am sure that Commissioner Almunia would like to discuss them with you at some later date .
I am in favour of the report because forests and other land are covered by more than 42 % of the EU &apos;s surface , ensuring that many workers and businesses in the forestry sector are maintained .
He is very well aware that , unfortunately , it was the governments of the Member States that decide the headquarters of the institutions , and it was under the chairmanship of the former leader of his party , John Major , at the Edinburgh Summit in 1992 , that the European Parliament was legally obliged to hold 12 sessions in Strasbourg .
The Committee considered that the peculiarities should not be appraised within the scope of the current European risk assessment carried out at European level on certain factors that trigger the theoretical nature of other actions .
We have always argued that we need to enter into a dialogue aimed at reconciliation , and this dialogue needs to be continued .
It is logical , first of all , to agree on the general outlines of the European Union 2020 strategy and then to present a review of the budget already prepared by the new Commission , so that the proposal will be a new College that will work closely with Parliament on the financial perspectives .
Due to the absence of a European policy to support the shipbuilding sector , it is unlikely that production will once again reach its level before the current crisis .
There is no point in insisting further insisting on the development of the Lisbon Strategy when the economic and social crisis , which is exacerbated by the implementation of this strategy , is worsening .
If we allow the current state of existence , freight transport will cease in twenty years &apos; time .
Furthermore , the great negotiating skills required by the rapporteur , Mr Rangel , must not be forgotten .
Since volcanic ash can result in the exclusion of air engines and in reduced visibility by winter aircraft , the European Organisation for Safety , Eurocontrol , has taken a responsible approach and made passenger safety its top priority .
It is therefore a legislative package that reconciles health and environmental interests with the interests of competitiveness and innovation , without prejudice to one another , which has been too frequent in the past .
I am critical of the concept of the voluntary collection of equipment by manufacturers .
It is expected that the results of this study will then be reflected in the report on decent work which will be published in 2011 .
I am aware that it is not perfect and that there are some doubts .
In addition to poverty , which is still a reality , we are also concerned about global environmental problems such as climate change , so we are now essentially talking about a global insurance component that will financially support the victims of socio-economic change caused by the financial disaster .
Finally , I would like to wish Commissioner Kovács every success in his future endeavours .
However , we do not support the passages that talk about increasing agricultural subsidies through the POSEI programme for EU producers affected by the agreement .
I believe that , when they start to act , the European Union should be able to play a more active and decisive role in defending the fundamental interests of the EU , which also concerns energy security .
I would like to emphasise once again that EU citizens are looking with interest to see how we will react to the Lisbon Treaty with great satisfaction .
We in the June List do not believe that the multiannual programme or the European Agency for linguistic diversity and science at EU level should provide any kind of additional burden for the people of Europe , in addition to the additional burden on the taxpayers .
However , this is the right thing to do in a sense - let us be honest - of a certain interinstitutional war that has been going on for years between the European Parliament and the Council .
It is to be welcomed that the lack of transparency is one of the reasons why the Commission is putting forward so many ill-considered , ill-considered , inadequate and unworked proposals that we have to deal with in England and other countries .
Is that understood !
However , it will be a little comfort for the people affected - who are in mourning and hard wounds - to insist further that the railways are the safest form of transport and that the number of accidents is very small compared with the number of road accidents .
Furthermore , we are calling for a solution to the forthcoming summit of the problem of the reintroduction by the Canadian Government of visa requirements for EU citizens from the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania .
The European Parliament also has a significant role to play .
It goes without saying that countries neighbouring the EU would have to apply a new , restrictive framework , and we will not , of course , be able to free from the nuclear power station once and for all .
( The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
Ladies and gentlemen , in accordance with the conditions and provisions of the Act on the election of Members of the European Parliament , I declare the opening of the first session of the European Parliament following the elections to be opened .
I voted in favour of this report because economic stability can also lead to political stability in this region , which has been experiencing acute difficulties in recent years .
Parliament has also improved the text by emphasising the importance of training legal professions in the area of cooperation and bringing our legal structures together by mutual recognition and trust , so that we can integrate the response instruments so that we can make the European Union a true area of freedom , justice and security .
What is the kind of difficulty in saying that , for the people of the Middle East , it should be the same ?
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , this debate is taking place at the right time because of tourism , the air travel sector and consumer protection .
I therefore support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , which seek to strike the right balance between privacy and the safety of individuals on the network , with full respect for their fundamental rights and freedoms .
Of course , we have democracy here : we are having a debate on the problem , and this is an interesting debate .
I am pleased that the European Parliament has finally come to the end and is discussing possible future courses of action in this area .
The European Union cannot wait until 2014 to make its regional and structural funds more flexible , it must do so now so so that the Roma , too , can benefit from this .
They must also be the result of legitimate interests : national security , public security , prevention of breaches of order or crime , health and moral protection , and so on .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , it represents the High Commissioner and the Commission .
We must act quickly and not only in relation to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - and we will be discussing this soon - but also in relation to Iraq .
Finally , the ALDE Group is very dissatisfied that , on the eve of the summit , Russia imposed a disproportionate ban on imports of vegetables from the EU .
It also shows that the burden of over-regulation , which often beset the EU &apos;s image , is not found in many cases in the EU institutions , but in the culpability of individual Member States .
This draft language law threatens the use of minority languages in all forms of life , while also helping to reconcile , among other things , the indigenous Hungarian minority that lives there .
in writing . - ( DE ) The dairy sector is currently in a crisis of unprecedented proportions : producer prices have fallen dramatically , consumer prices have increased and many farms in the EU are struggling to survive .
We welcome the rejection of the European Commission &apos;s proposal , chaired by Commissioner Durão Barrot , which aims to exclude self-employed workers from the Directive on the organisation of working time for persons performing mobile road transport activities , as a result of our proposal to reject the Commission &apos;s proposal .
In this context , the political parties , citizens , in demonstrations and in the European trade unions , which are known in Europe are convinced that Eurobonds can play a key role in overcoming the debt crisis and in ensuring the stability of the euro .
We should not reduce this level of ambition .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Explanations of vote
Secondly , we want to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers .
SMEs are the engine of the European economy and of sustainable growth , creating many valuable jobs .
Other factors have been ignored , such as actual admission of the German language , which is one of the working languages referred to in the treaties .
The longer we wait for the adoption of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme , the greater the risk of terrorist attacks that can be prevented .
Mr President , this is not the first time we have had a debate in Parliament on this issue .
This also means strengthening the education sector and investing in education , research and innovation as a cornerstone of a sustainable social market economy and a more environmentally sustainable economy .
It is a pity that the resolution was drawn up much later than the statements made by some Heads of State and UN officials on the deployment of several dozens of thousands of US soldiers in the country .
The costs and the bureaucracy that the wrong policy of multilingualism entails will increase as the EU exchanges further .
And that has not been done .
This may seem to be a case of a distant future , but if a separate Burmese people are to know something from us in this European Parliament , the fact that tyranny can never give the go-ahead of freedom and that freedom , which is an inalienable nation , will surely once again become involved .
We need to address this issue in a solidarity and coordinated way , rather than submitting each other to each other &apos;s hands as &apos; every man of the skin &apos; .
The agenda will be pursued with three documents on broadband communications : firstly , it concerns broadband communications and contains detailed information on the implementation of the radio spectrum agenda ; the second recommendations concerning access to new generation ; and aims to clarify the basis for accelerated broadband investments ; and the third is the radio spectrum policy programme , which will form the basis of the Commission &apos;s broadband strategy .
The aim of this directive is sufficiently clear : we need more authorities for patients and closer cooperation between Member States on this issue and in combating illegal organ trafficking .
There has been far too little effort in the process of rescuing the banks in order to be able to respond to this predictable situation .
As far as production and employment are concerned , there are now only a few nuances in the medium-sized and high-quality , luxury and ultra-modern sectors .
In order to achieve this confidence , it is harmful when the government elevates the banks to stress tests at the summer and only a few months later realises that , in fact , this was a stress test for the euro and not for the banks .
I welcome the adoption of this report because , in terms of supporting research and innovation - which is the driving force behind the European Union &apos;s growth both now and in the future - it takes into account the general sentiments of the people most affected , namely the need to simplify and monitor financial and administrative aspects of projects while strengthening the process of scientific and technological evaluation .
Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
I believe that the duty of political parties and parliamentary groups who oppose such populism and demagoguery is to talk more openly about this .
With regard to the current emergency measures , I would like to draw attention to the fact that increasing the minimum subsidy from EUR 7.5 000 to EUR 15 000 can result in problems for Member States with a more difficult budgetary situation .
( The sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m. )
I would ask you , at the end of your speech , to respond to some of these very real problems , so that citizens know that these problems are the subject of our discussions .
You mentioned five points just now , but the context of the strategy , that is , the idea that the Europe 2020 strategy also addresses economic , social and environmental issues , at least we see the risk that this context will be lost .
These are not my words .
As a result , a large majority , including the majority of your fellow citizens , is in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon .
We must therefore be careful about this .
We should fight this and we should support those who are punished in this way .
I am sorry , but that is not possible .
I consider restrictive and sanction measures to be an important instrument of the EU &apos;s foreign and security policy , just as , of course , in the area of justice and the protection of fundamental human rights .
This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises , which form the backbone of our economy .
( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , but I would like to draw attention to one important matter in connection with it .
Our support for this resolution has been clear , namely , to send a signal that the European Parliament and the Labour MEPs are working in the long term to rebuild the damaged infrastructure , communities and living together with the people of Haiti .
It is clear that we are committed to continuing to support such actions and to continue to address this issue in the European Union , not only in the context of preventing violence and supporting victims , but also in the context of immigration , asylum and criminal justice .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Many Member States have a shared responsibility with regard to Guantánamo , for example , because they have authorised transfers for the illegal transportation of prisoners .
In line with the principles of our programme , trade policy remains an important tool for responding to the opportunities and challenges resulting from globalisation and for supporting economic growth , creating jobs and ensuring greater prosperity for all European citizens .
Therefore , for us , let us say honestly , that barriers need to be abolished .
I would like to add one more area that is related to some concerns , namely the authorisation of products from outside the European Union .
Unfortunately , we realise in time that there are many actions that deliberately intend to conceal the irresponsibility that still exists in our institutions , including the vague legislative powers that are assigned to it .
I would like to talk about a few important political aspects because , as has been said earlier , Tunisia is a society in which , although to a limited extent , it has a multi-party political system where the opposition is undoubtedly closely defined , but it is nevertheless a multi-party political system .
We had a problem with the appointment of 18 additional Members of the European Parliament , because some Member States did not actually plan the procedure , but we felt that the most important issue is representation that this principle should be guided and that this House should have sustainable representation as soon as possible .
As has already been said here today , reasonable land use , economic and social development that harmonises nature and greater cohesion in the European Union are also important factors in disaster prevention .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and look forward to further progress in this relationship .
The texts before us are not only frameworks and guidelines , but they are also setting out real , concrete measures to be taken .
Furthermore , I think that the proposals need to be made beyond the point of making the internal market more environmentally friendly - for example , through green public procurement .
I refer to the importance of the amendment setting out how to resolve the issue of observers , bearing in mind that observers should be chosen of the main candidates chosen for the European Parliament elections .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s resolutions : see Minutes
We can talk about 2020 , but today we are facing a more serious problem : it is the euro area and Greece .
Information and communication technologies ( ICT ) are an important sector , not least given its importance in the European economy - it employs 7 % of all working in Europe and generates 6 % of European GDP , that is , it makes a significant contribution to the European economy , European manufacturing and employment requirements .
I think that we can expect a whole series of initiatives requiring the Commission to take further action , a more European approach , and the Commission will certainly not be enthusiastic about such requests .
If we do not assume our responsibilities and if we do not adopt a clear position , we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier : we must realise that , as we said in the digital agenda , every European should be able to develop its interest through the possibilities that ultimately have for the spectrum .
Such organisations are building their foundations by responding to the daily needs of citizens and then strengthening their power by means of terror .
Statements by the President
in writing . - I supported the Commission &apos;s radio spectrum policy programme because I believe that all EU citizens should have access to broadband by 2020 .
The consequences of unlimited exploitation of its natural resources can be catastrophic not only for the environment and indigenous peoples , but also for the whole world .
( RO ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Győri on the current functions and wishing her and the Hungarian Presidency every success .
We also need to take further action on nanomaterials and we can do this quickly after the cloning part .
A fruitful partnership in the field of financial services , economic governance , the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy , energy and the internal market is particularly important .
Emerging countries - China , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia - also adopt obligations at national level which go beyond the demands of the scientific community .
The protocol provides for a financial contribution of EUR 682 500 a year for the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe of the EU , of which EUR 227 500 will be allocated to support the implementation of the fisheries policy of the Republic , which I believe is appropriate .
We will see how this happens in the future .
I also hope that the Council will take more seriously Parliament &apos;s efforts in this regard , although I am very saddened , and I am very concerned that the representative of the Council is no longer here .
If we Europeans are to play an important role in this respect , it is important that we do not stop acting .
This report is another element of pressure on the European Council , the Commission and the Member States to take action on homelessness .
For example , in the case of the expulsion of the family , it must be possible to choose whether to travel together with a person expelled or stay on the spot .
This appalling agreement was stuck and ratified in August .
Negotiations with Japan with a view to strengthening trade relations must not be used as a class weapon in the service of large financial institutions and companies promoting increased exploitation of workers and others , the destruction of their productive forces and environmental degradation .
We confirm that we will do what we have committed ourselves to and what was promised in the Institute for Internal Audit by the end of the year .
between July and August , in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in the region of the Eastern Congo alone , more than 500 people , including children , girls and women aged between 75 , have been subjected to collective rape .
Therefore , the initial draft report , which provides for the implementation of the House of European History and the colossal costs of its management , was entirely contrary to my deep conviction that , where public money is involved , fiscal restraint is needed .
In addition , these are investments that do not bring about immediate profit , but are being made in order to have reserves .
I would also like to emphasise that , as the previous speaker said , we are ready to provide assistance to third countries .
This directive on cross-border healthcare is important , even if it involves only 1 % of national health budgets because , apart from the figures , we should focus on the symbol , which is the right right of every European citizen to be treated abroad and reimbursed with all the relevant information .
Nevertheless , I call for the implementation of the initial measures to encourage healthy life , which is an essential factor in improving health .
Due to the different legal differences in regulations and the often limited impact on the enforcement of internalisation laws in the fight against violence , there is a growing need for clear and binding regulations at EU level .
What is your view of these unplanned commitments within the framework of the euro system ?
Freedom of expression and information , including freedom of expression and information , without any kind of interference or pressure , are social values that have been fought for for for for many years , including in Portugal .
I think we can still save our planet .
In short , as we have said many times before , we need a robust , well-financed cohesion policy that is present in all regions of the European Union .
In essence , I share these concerns , and I can also see that Turkmenistan still has some work to do , which will achieve full compliance with international standards of democracy and human rights .
An increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of reduced labour costs in some countries , particularly China and India , with damaging effects on countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am particularly addressing the members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) - there is no point in defending one or other group in Ukraine for political reasons .
EN ( The sitting was closed at 23 : 45 . )
Mr President , the Arab world is our partner in the Union for the Mediterranean .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , whose views on this programme are very similar to ours and , above all , to all , to congratulate everyone who is working on this issue , because in this period of economic crisis , it is of paramount importance to conduct a programme that has positive social effects .
The Commission is looking forward to establishing a special relationship with Parliament , including with regard to these regulations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the Commissioners , we must ensure that the aid promises made at the aforementioned conference are transformed into specific financial resources and reach the people for whom they are intended .
It is precisely this committee that takes political decisions which are citizen-focused and which are necessary , especially in the context of the crisis we are experiencing .
The European Council must make the necessary preparations , but it should not draw premature conclusions .
If firms were not shut down in Portugal a week after week , there would not be as many unemployed and people living in poverty .
If we were to set up a fund of truce , as the Party of European Socialists proposed , we would guarantee that Member States who are victims of unscrupulous speculators would be able to help themselves out of the attacks without direct burden on taxpayers , thereby getting lower margins .
Of the new cases of breaches in 2007 , 1196 was about the lack of notification of national transposition measures for Community directives .
I think that a balance needs to be struck between environmental protection , on the one hand , and bureaucracy and costs for industry and smaller installations , such as facilities in agriculture and health services , on the other .
The EIB will gladly make an important contribution to the implementation of the strategy .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating my friend , Mrs Weber , on her exemplary work on this report .
I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission seem to agree on a number of priorities in this regard .
In fact , it will provide international and national road transport on the shoulders of large monopolies .
- Report : Klaus / Heiner Lehne
If you use antibiotics on such a scale , then it is hardly surprising that there are strains of bacteria which do not react to antibiotics .
This directive does not provide for the adoption of the principle of protecting migrant workers and protecting those who , as they are forced to work in unacceptable conditions , report to employers .
I am very pleased that we have rejected a project that is on the agenda only so that the left can attack their political opponents in Italy .
You are absolutely right .
It is true that there have been lively discussions in the Council about the best way of ensuring that the peripheral Member States do not feel isolated ; after all , the Council will forming a qualified majority and I hope - and I think this discussion shows this - that this will also be the case in Parliament .
Amendment 43 should not result in the rejection of Amendment 54 because Amendment 54 deals with cases which do not include Amendment 43 .
Order of business
Climate change is the only environmental problem facing us , but it is necessary to try and resolve it in Copenhagen .
However , in order to ensure this or to identify and monitor the conditions , there is no need for a new authority .
- ( HU ) I welcome the Council &apos;s decision on the position for the forthcoming G20 summit .
We should consider whether we need new sources of income ; if so , we do not need to look far , because there are always those who have always been rich in this difficult situation to describe .
in writing . - As a staunch opponent of the EU and its constant interference in our lives , I have consistently voted against the vast majority of the reports that I was asked to consider .

Some of the honourable Members have asked about the Gaza Strip to ensure that aid reaches , to continue to support the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip - what we are doing , but we are also talking about broadening and improving it .
I also voted in favour of this report because it calls for a more transparent , fairer and simpler European Union financing system .
While the European Union must maintain its relations with the Russian Government , we must remind the government constantly that we demand that the democratic state and the democratic ethics always take precedence and that any attempt at censorship of views that the government cannot accept or exert inadequate pressure on politicians should not be accepted by the European Union .
( NL ) Mr President , unfortunately , at Copenhagen , giants - the United States , China , India , Brazil - did not join the European giant .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am convinced that research and innovation are not an option for Europe , but a need if we want a long-term solution to protect our social model and environmental sustainability .
There is no doubt that the aim is to retain raw materials as part of an attempt to obtain more attractive exchange rates for its exports .
You can choose it .
Developing countries are right in saying that it was not they who caused this crisis .
With regard to such action , the European Union should play its part by analysing possible technical measures to complement UN sanctions , of course in due time and form , and by reaffirming its readiness to conduct a debate and dialogue that must not be stopped , even in the face of difficulties .
As the current directive has proved to be ineffective in discouraging late payments , I also supported the strengthening of the current legislation .
For the first time since then , it has become clear to us that the United States is much more open to our reservations and to finding constructive solutions than we thought .
In fact , Commissioner Rehn said here that he had to agree on the budget first and then can hold general elections .
I would like to draw your attention to at least a matter of wonder : in the United States , the use of leaflets as a component has been banned , but the European Medicines Agency apparently allows it to be used , as the majority of vaccines are contained in its composition .
The European Social Fund is the most effective tool for combating unemployment , the rules of which we are currently greatly simplifying in order to speed up payments .
I think we now need to wait for the transposition of this package ; we need to implement it and see how it will work before we decide whether anything is necessary .
New areas have been added to the strengthening of cooperation : the fight against terrorism and organised crime ; the prevention of the activities of tenants ; the fight against the production and excessive collection of shot and light bulbs ; and cooperation on migration .
I consider the lack of democratic control of this fund to be detrimental to the transparency of its development policy .
Firstly , despite all concerns and fears among the population , we must not forget the principles .
The resolution clearly mentions and criticises the measures taken by the current government , but forgets that Mrs Iervolino &apos;s current Naples number is in the centre left and , worse still , forgets the long governance of Mr Bassolino , who was Naples between 1993 and 2000 and the Governor of Campania by many years to 2000 , as well as the Commissioner for the special waste management crisis .
Please stand up for democracy once again .
In addition to what has already been said about the precautionary principle and basic traceability - the most important thing - it is also the question of knowledge how the general alert will abolish Spanish cucumbers , and only because of dubious and even unjustified accusations .
In this respect , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the report is inadequate : it still contains too many conditions for prior authorisation and makes it more difficult for the Member States .
The future of the region requires strong , tolerant democracy , respecting the rights of minorities , and in which the state is for all , and in which the country does not serve a few abuses .
I hope that Estonia will enter the euro area on 1 January 2011 in order to create an area that enables economic development and the resolution of financial difficulties .
Therefore , stakeholders , including sectoral associations , largely agree on a option with only English .
The only solution for working men and women is disobedience and a lack of coordination with the decisions of the European Union and its institutions .
At the same time , political dialogue has now disappeared .
I am tabling an oral amendment concerning a split vote on the lower wording of paragraph 10 : &apos; considers it wrong to incorporate this idea into the protocol on common standards in relation to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and all forms of discrimination &apos; .
We must raise this target and do so , but only when the circumstances are adequate .
The EU should take action on TERAz .
As regards financial services , I agree that their suppliers should ensure transparency at a certain level , but I have some doubts about the wording of your draft .
We voted against this report because we cannot accept the budget that is at the root of this report , which is clearly referred to in the first recital of the compromise draft , which accepts the elimination of milk quotas .
Madam President , this is indeed very good news .
We will do our utmost to make everything clear .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to point out that I cannot speak in Catalan because it is not yet officially recognised as a language , although it is spoken by more than 10 million Europeans .
The Union must modernise its energy infrastructure and ensure interconnections between Member States &apos; energy infrastructure .
If Russia does not accept Ukraine &apos;s European course , it alone must deal with this , as does the political impact on the countries of the USSR bloc .
Therefore , I would like to remind you of the decision taken yesterday in plenary in which we rejected the resolution on Aminatou Haidar in order not to jeopardise the diplomatic negotiations under way .
Mr President , we are talking about the situation in Belarus , but let us beat first .
Countries with the largest producers , supported by the majority of MEPs , who feel sensitive to the arguments of the industrial sector , have succeeded in preventing us from adopting an ambitious target to reduce emissions .
It was excellent that we were able to work on a document which I think is a very honest report that contains a clear vision of the direction in which the CAP , after 2013 , should , in Parliament &apos;s view , move .
The US example shows that flexibility is not the same as a lack of security , but rather a dynamic labour market .
As President of the European Commission , I endorse the principles laid down in the regulation that has been adopted .
We must send out a clear signal now that we are looking forward to those responsible for the future of this key treaty for the Union , our institutions and the 500 million Europeans whom we represent .
All these vaccines and treatments are examples of the benefits of animal testing .
Documents received : see Minutes
Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work , because this initiative has an important symbolic value , which goes far beyond the agreed EUR 146 million , the effects of which , I believe , will be eight times greater .
I believe that Europe &apos;s cultural spirit is an important means of bringing Europeans closer together in a way that fully respects their cultural and linguistic identities .
I think it is very important not only to promote competitiveness in the agricultural sector , but also to promote traditional agricultural practices , small-scale farming , organic agriculture and local distribution .
Special derogations have also been allowed for remote rural areas and islands , such as Orkney and Szekney , in my own constituency , in the absence of a longer journey period .
A reformed policy is causing anger and feeling of profession for our citizens and the decision-making procedures , as the recent European elections have shown , discourage them from participating .
As regards the delays , you are absolutely right : there has been some delay .
In this resolution , we call on the Commission to respond without delay to the legitimate concerns raised by the petitioner , who has been experiencing this intolerable situation for 13 years , thereby causing considerable damage to the loss of earnings and , in addition , the Commission should take the necessary measures to enable the petitioner to assert his rights .
Full support , effective implementation and sufficient respect for existing legislation and instruments for the protection of human rights and civil liberties are a way of achieving these goals .
Never before was the European project put to such a harsh test .
What are we going to do when , while the value of the dollar is falling , the Americans are selling fuel , subsidised and publicised sharply advertisements in our market , which is also recommended by low-carbon cars from Turkey , India and China ?
Mr President , I would like to ask you an evaluation of this , less than two weeks ago , of the EU-Ukraine Summit .
We want common , European solutions .
As some of my fellow Members have already pointed out , if these matters were clarified , it would be a good idea for the Commission to consult the European Parliament in its mandate .
It is very important that , as Europeans , we ensure that the European message also reaches Belarus and that it will bring hope .
The new European Neighbourhood Policy that we have been promised is the same , only in the new publication - it will acquire a few additional democratic slogans .
It is clear that these measures represent only a partial , incomplete solution to the problem of illegal immigration and work .
Please do not fool yourselves : we are very clear , I am very clear to all the leaders with whom I am talking about what I think should be done , and I am doing so with the support of this Parliament and the Foreign Affairs Council , which is made up of 27 Member States .
I do not exaggerate : one of the reports considers it necessary to say that , in the event of a change in the majority after the elections , the new government must be allowed to change the budgetary priorities of the predecessor and then can only make cosmetic amendments .
Moreover , while our political differences naturally change , our relationship as people has considerably improved .
It is therefore important for us to go much further than the pilot project you mentioned , Commissioner .
In fact , the issue of nuclear energy is regulated in such a way that every Member State has its nuclear safety regulator , which is fully accountable for the application of nuclear safety measures .
What is interesting , however , is that , although the problems caused by the financial crisis affect many countries , it is also true - as Mr Lamberts probably knows - that in most countries that enjoy stable public finances , they are not governed by socialist cabinet .
There are possible different scenarios : from the peaceful takeover of power by pro-democracy forces to economic chaos and the explosion of the armed conflict , without even excluding nuclear weapons .
In our ageing population , the number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer &apos;s and dementia will continue to increase .
As far as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the revision of the European Social Fund is concerned , I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation that dialogue was very constructive that achieving our objectives is within the scope of this sitting , and I believe that this is very important .
What about encouraging the Member States , once they have submitted the EGF application , to begin to introduce measures that would apply within the EGF , at least that would ensure that workers are not waiting for a request for the fund ?
These strategies and programmes cannot remain on paper alone , as this would only highlight the inconsistencies and mistrust of the acts adopted by the European Union itself .
I cannot imagine how comfort one can feel by doing the oppressive regime and supporting the amendments that are an opportunity for Iran to attack and weakening the opposition movement that has taken place in defence of human rights and democracy in Iran .
in writing . - I voted against the introduction of EU-level contract law because , in my opinion , Brussels should not legislate in an area where national legislation already exists .
His election to the office of President brought hope and change not only in the US , but also throughout the world , including in Europe .
That is why I support the proposals put forward by the Commission ; many of which I referred to in my report on the Community Code on the movement of persons across borders .
However , we are opposed to the wording in paragraph 8 , which states that the tax burden on average and low wages should be reduced significantly and significantly through tax relief , tax reductions and tax pressures .
In many cases , when a country &apos;s government has not long been involved in dialogue or in programmes for improving the situation , resolutions relating to specific countries are the only action that the international community can take against these crimes .
We do not have a legislative resolution or the position of the new Parliament .
However , the accident should apply when it is justified for the sake of security policy .
Co-Chairman also called on the LTTTE to lay down its arms , but unfortunately , this call was rejected and even ignored .
I agree that it is possible to call on countries with surplus structural reforms , but most attention should be paid to deficit countries .
I would therefore ask you to apply the roll-call vote on the second part of paragraph 12 .
However , despite this , I am pleased that the vast majority in Parliament has decided to resolve the matter in the way we have just decided .
This is our European path , which may not be in line with other paths .
This project , the European scheme for supervising the consumption of veterinary antimicrobials , started in the third quarter of 2009 .
Given that research plays a key role in economic development and job creation , there must be no increase in bureaucracy and unjustified delays that prevent the scientific community from participating in programmes at all costs .
The banks are in good financial condition , yet they are praised when it turns out that they freely throw a few hour to save Greece .
This document shows that Member States are managing increasingly to implement EU law .
The best way to reduce population growth is to protect the lives of children , so that people do not feel the need to increase their families .
I therefore welcome the proposal to lay down clear rules for defining these categories of wine , so that the high quality of European production can always be identified and valued .
The initiative will only succeed if it is easy to implement and accessible to all .
I think that particular attention should be paid to Amendment 7 .
We therefore welcome this communication , which announces a new , ambitious approach to Single Market policy , allowing us to restore confidence in our model of a social market economy .
( The speaker agrees to take another Member &apos;s question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As you know , the second round of the presidential elections was held in Ukraine on Sunday .
The Hungarian Government should ensure an effective guarantee of freedom and pluralism in the media and should therefore withdraw this law or fundamentally change it - on the basis of the remarks and proposals of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe , the European Council and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and , by means of open , transparent debate with the participation of all stakeholders , NGOs and citizens .
The Prüm Convention has been introduced by force in European law without proper democratic supervision .
I would also like to remind our Liberal colleagues , above all , Mr Rohde , that the reason why Mr Marks advocated free trade was its appalling consequences , believed that the laudable interests of the British bourgis in the background of this decision were not of great importance : the Indian people had to be destroyed in order to provoke the world revolution .
Ladies and gentlemen , Kenya is against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human Rights and People &apos;s Rights .
Firstly , the protection of populations lies within the competence of the Member States , and all coordination initiatives should be built on this basis .
In 2008 , the United Nations Special Rapporteur for extra-judicial executions wrote : &apos; The assassinations eliminated civil society leaders , including human rights defenders , trade unionists and supporters of local reform , have lost a large proportion of civil society activists and reduced political discourse in the country &apos; .
I do not agree with the previous speaker because I believe that the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon will give us the opportunity to bring citizens closer to the EU in a much more positive way .
We are at the highest level of civilisation and arms , higher than in the Cold War , which is far from pragmatic demilitarisation policies .
This will allow us to make sure that we can create real , effective economic governance for the benefit of all Member States .
I think - and this positive message will be with me if this House moves forward , which I hope will translate into just as large a majority tomorrow - we have made sure that the control system really works .
We have also tried to express as transparent as possible our wish that not only high quality public stations , attractive content , but also the use of new platforms , taking into account the latest technologies .
Madam President , two years ago , there was a problem in Ireland .
Although we cannot expect miracles from this agreement , it is a step in the right direction , which has led me to vote in favour of this report .
Once again , this is an intergovernmental mechanism that has been invented by the Ecofin Council and which requires unanimity .
This goes against the real objective of regional support , namely , strengthening the weakest regions .
One symbol , one proposal - that is precisely where we should all work together .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
However , we will only be able to give the required dimension to our action if there is a clear commitment from the Libyan authorities .
In this way , we are already sending a strong signal to the institutions in the new composition , Parliament and the Commission .
There is also a risk that real criminals adjust to the profiling that has been created by the use of innocent people as drug courses and car growers , or by changing their route of travel so that they can move away from trains monitored .
Other essential elements are better access to schools , higher levels of vocational and academic education and improving social conditions for women in rural areas .
However , the challenges are still present .
Economic Partnership Agreements will be unacceptable if they do not promote regional integration and do not contribute to development in the ACP countries and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
I believe that the most important point in this context is the need to agree on a new budget for Europe and the European Union for the next few years .
The EU must give fundamental importance to research and innovation in tackling challenges such as climate change and in seeking solutions that are capable of facing increased competition in the world .
Europe is divided on this issue .
This is good news , and we must thank all those who , and sometimes in the regions , are responsible for implementing this directive .
According to the UN , 20-40 % of global timber production is the result of illegal logging .
I know that it ends up with a mandate and , although we do not always have the same opinion , I think everyone agrees with me that it has put a huge amount of work into this report .
This proposal , which is supported by the Council of Europe , is long-awaited by all those who conduct an campaign to respect the integration rights of marginalised communities and the Roma in particular .
Otherwise , any act of the European Parliament adopted by this House , which includes 754 Members - over three per limit of 751 Members - will be invalid .
However , we have not discussed the Digital Agenda so long ; we all support the Digital Agenda and this is an important element of this agenda .
I would like to thank you for the fact that this debate is being held together .
Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with the ICTY is a condition for the accession of a given country to the EU , but it is true that Commissioner Orban told me openly yesterday evening , in the absence of Commissioner Rehn , that there is no unanimity in the Council as to how this cooperation is understood .
The Arctic Council is focusing on cooperation in the fields of the environment and in the field of research , but agreements focusing on the use of natural resources are linked to the growing need for international administration strategies , and the EU , too , can play a role .
However , I strongly support the very restrictive approach to access to the profession of the road transport operator .
When we accede to the European Union , we have opened our markets and we are contributing the same amount to the budget , and we are also contributing in other ways .
Unfortunately , at the moment , the absence of a European mechanism or an institution capable of coordinating an integrated economic recovery of the continent and , therefore , we are once again using a mosaic of solutions which can , in total , fail , as the economies of the Member States are heavily dependent on themselves .
Let me just say that , as far as we are concerned , we are giving a very clear definition of price stability that allows everyone to judge what we are now dealing with in real time .
On training personnel , the Council shares the Commission &apos;s view that there is a need to vaccinate the genuine culture of the EU in the area of justice , including by promoting the direct exchange of judges , prosecutors and justice professionals between Member States and actively developing a European judicial network .
We should make a joint effort in the future in this direction .
However , this has not happened .
However , I would like to remind Parliament - and this is an issue that came up recently in Greece on important matters - that it is still the case that those who have been prosecuted for serious crimes of fraud or corruption in a Member State have disappealed or avoid detention , using different procedures and regulations in individual national legislation .
A general framework has also been created in which individual elements can complement and strengthen each other .
Before the vote :
The most important message from our debate today to the Member States must be that Romania and Bulgaria meet the same criteria for joining the Schengen area as the European Union has been expecting from the countries which have joined so far .
European contract law , which is debated in detail in the institutions , can bring numerous benefits to businesses and consumers and can also contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market .
Politically , it was unacceptable to vote today ( 24 November 2009 ) in plenary on this report , which contains incorrect facts .
We cannot , on the one hand , criticise the United States indefinitely because of the Guantánamo prison and , on the other , we cannot show willingness or desire to help solve this problem .
That is why we voted against .
The phenomenon of emigration , driven by crisis situations and instability , has a negative impact on the country of origin , a country of destination and for displaced persons themselves .
Madam President , I do not know what has happened , but I would like to speak as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ( ITRE ) .
As far as Serbia is concerned , the people living in Kosovo or people of Kosovo reside abroad , and a Serbian passport issued by the central authorities in Belgrade , will be exempt from liberalisation and will have to obtain a visa .
Passengers should have the choice between receiving reimbursement of ticket prices and continuing their journeys on the same terms without additional costs .
Let us make sure that we have binding energy efficiency targets that are put into practice .
This question was put to me on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism because , in the summer , Members were very concerned about the collapse of SkyEurope and asked me to take the initiative on their behalf .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
Firstly , we need to overcome the disparities resulting from the growing disparities between average life expectancy and retirement age .
Proposals :
What remains for discussion is whether we believe that we will be able to agree on all the details , including the form of an agreement , at the summit in Mexico .
The OSCE is increasingly pointing out to the Council of Europe as the main and most appropriate forum for debating democracy - together with its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights , which support election observation - human rights and the rule of law in Europe .
It is a good compromise and I very much hope that it will receive broad support in tomorrow &apos;s vote .
I recently reminded Parliament that there is no free elections in Belarus , freedom of expression , association and protest do not exist , and the authorities will intensify their repressive action .
The statement should be scientifically justified , taking into account the general data available and by assessing scientific evidence .
This is , of course , an extremely valuable piece of information for patients in health care but , as a result of the possibility of abuse for promotional purposes , it must be framed within a strict framework .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as a result of repeated accidents and the growing volume of transportation of hazardous goods by sea , there are still urgent problems with tightening the safety rules for all maritime traffic in the European Union and the resources needed to enforce these regulations .
The second point concerns nuclear energy .
Then there will be a technical part , which includes transforming this into a legally binding text .
It is therefore important for the social aspects clause to be increasingly frequent in bilateral agreements .
This area offers a good opportunity to demonstrate this in practice .
Tuesday :
In order to strengthen this practical cooperation , the 2008 European Pact on Asylum and Immigration proposed the establishment of the Asylum Support Office , which was subsequently agreed in the Stockholm Programme in 2009 .
This week , we celebrated 8 March .
Madam President , I thank the honourable Member for this point , but I would like to inform her that I represent Poland and not Lithuania .
Mr President , I am pleased that the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs can finally be taken to plenary .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs García Pérez and Mr Jöns and Mr Angelakas for their excellent reports , as well as all the Members who have spoken today .
I know that these events are being followed by many Members of this Parliament and by national parliaments across Europe .
We will therefore reiterate our call to Russia once again to do its utmost to ensure that human rights defenders are able to do their work without having to live in fear of violence , persecution or differences .
Furthermore , unnecessary complications may undermine legitimacy and harm the visibility of the EU &apos;s accession process to the convention .
Opening of the sitting
I believe that we should stop exerting pressure on the Tunisian Government , which has many other issues to deal with concerning its own refugees - as has been said - and overseeing the democratic transition .
We must continue pursuing economic , social and territorial cohesion policies in order to reduce disparities between regions and create a platform for sustainable economic development , in line with what the Treaty of Lisbon also provides for .
We will now vote .
Google &apos;s human rights groups have accused Google of helping the Chinese Government to represse its citizens , especially human rights activists .
At the moment , the most important thing is that the amendments to the proposed directive be swiftly tabled and implemented as soon as possible .
In the face of such a situation , I repeat the proposal to create a assembly of eastern neighbouring countries called Euroeast with the involvement of the European Parliament and on the basis of principles such as the Euromed and EuroLat assembly , which would be the task of implementing the ENPI in the countries of Eastern Europe .
The key issue we need to discuss is financing the European budget and future financial perspectives .
We need to inform our citizens what it means and how they can use the tools that we make available to them by means of this directive , so that they do not fall into the trap of the purchase of falsified medicines .
It is also important to create a level playing field in the credit rating industry by promoting competition , greater transparency , opening up the market and stability .
It is estimated that 200 to 300 000 children in more than 20 countries around the world are currently directly involved in armed conflicts .
( PL ) Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , the Spanish Presidency has decided to prepare the evaluation of the Copenhagen climate conference , which we are talking about here , according to many speeches , that it has failed .
These changes are essential for the future promotion of the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) .
Commissioner , you mentioned the Lisbon Strategy , innovation , the environment economy , and you know that this European strategy has been a failure .
No , it only intends to continue paying export subsidies .
( DE ) Madam President , in the case of each country , one should think about his roots and see whether the changes in the human rights and rights of minorities are heading in the right direction .
It is also important for fishing companies to be encouraged by legislation to use the best equipment currently available for selectivity , avoiding such large volumes of non-exchange of fish and fish species other than target species or catches .
We will continue to push for this .
As the Commissioner rightly points out , our main competitors and economic partners have , for many years , been applying origin marking for products coming into their territory .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday 20 May , at 12 noon .
While the EU supports the Copenhagen proposals to further reduce the West and dominate the world &apos;s corporatory department , more and more ordinary society sees climate change as an excuse for the taxation and control of us and to impose the imperialist and global dogma at the expense of the nation state &apos;s nation state .
Furthermore , we are in constant contact with third countries , especially Russia , to ask for the lifting of the embargo , which we consider to be disproportionate .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner Hahn , these proposals can now be compared to putting a heavy toll on the shoulders of people who are already experiencing enough difficulties and then telling them that they must face the burden more quickly .
Once again , I applaud their courage and determination .
At the same time , the consequences of the irresponsible budgetary policies applied so far in several Member States will , of course , continue to give the European Union a sign for the next few years .
The first reason is that science is global discipline and progress in this area , which we can share , contributes to increasing human aspirations .
Let me conclude by saying :
In a situation where support is decreasing and in the run-up to the introduction of a series of extremely harsh austerity measures that have a radical impact on living standards , the Romanian Government is resorting to the increasingly violent anti-democratic way of sustaining power .
Let us come back to a utopia , a utopia for peace !
We believe that the European Union is on track and we want through controls and transparency to ensure that we achieve the 20 % reduction target and that everything can succeed in Europe .
It also proposes better opportunities for financing projects in this area , namely , the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development , the EU &apos;s public health programme , programmes for Youth and Citizens and the Lifelong Learning Programme .
As the members of the Committee are only seven miles , and their task is very responsible , it is important that they are people with uncomfortable reputation and high competence .
Even if we cannot offer them close membership prospects , we should develop economic and political cooperation in our common European interest .
Following a public consultation conducted last year , the Commission is now assessing comments on collective redress and wants to find a solution that meets the needs of European consumers , without importing practices in the United States .
Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens and the best way to engage in such a dialogue with the citizens of Europe is to listen to what they say in democratic votes .
I think this evening &apos;s debate is proof of Parliament &apos;s remarkable unanimity in matters such as the EU &apos;s nomination of a special EU coordinator for Tibet .
I hope it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States in the same way as other EU citizens .
It is a good example and point of reference , and it is also a good lesson to us by the second in terms of poverty on our planet : when we entered the Court &apos;s building , we saw the word &apos; there is no peace without justice &apos; .
In this situation , cooperation between the Union and the Council is essential in order to guarantee energy needs and avoid rising oil prices on the global market .
If we do not manage to provide clear answers to these questions , these two objectives , linked to the growth of employment and the reduction of poverty , will suffer the same fate as the Lisbon Strategy .
- Before the vote :
Mr Amado said : &apos; I did not talk about preventing the calm of the European institutions &apos; .
I hope that 2010 will also prove good for Croatia and the Western Balkans , but I would also like to emphasise the need to take into account and address the issue of refugees and people who had to move within the country .
I know that is not easy .
Madam President , I would like to add my voice to the calls for this proposal to be withdrawn and for a new proposal from the Commission on a different legal basis .
There are a number of review clauses in the text with the aim of ensuring good functioning , but once again , I would like to cite the words of Diana Wallis that the introduction of these exceptions was a key condition for reaching a compromise .
The Commission &apos;s position is commendable , as it places responsibility on the Member States for the safe management of this area , including the storage of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste , and requires that this is achieved by preparing their own programmes .
In my opinion , this text is another instrument that the EU can use , because it contains a coherent and effective strategy on the phenomenon of migration and points out the most suitable way to restore the conditions conducive to political , economic and social stability .
Mr President , I would like to thank everyone for their support and attention ; this also applies to those who oppose this report .
Our third objective was to simplify and facilitate access to financing instruments for the SME sector .
At the same time , Ukraine must speed up its reforms .
I would like to highlight the concerns of the rapporteur , who reflects the concerns of his entire group in relation to the promotion of young people .
Let us exercise our competence to ensure that these rights and freedoms are respected by the Treaties and we will continue to do so .
The number of errors has fallen , but we have still not achieved &apos; an acceptable level of error &apos; .
Too many children are poor and face educational and health problems resulting from sustainable poverty .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this Europe 2020 programme , as a great strategy for bringing us out of the crisis , is being watered down by political provocation .
We have agreed on five objectives , one of which is social inclusion ; this must be the responsibility of the European Union under the Treaty .
We have seen how important this problem is with the regulation we have adopted recently when , in a few million households in the European Union , we have mentioned CRT TV in the modern LCD panels .
We need to invest in countries neighbouring the EU , especially the east , by providing them with the motivation they need to continue with the reforms and we need to be able to make the EU more active in this area .
The most effective criteria must be laid down , taking into account the increasing number of equipment produced and its impact on health and the environment when it is not guaranteed at the end of the usage cycle .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the issue of information on prescription-only medicines is a sensitive subject , as this information has significant effects in terms of protecting the right to health and well-being of all citizens .
José Manuel Barroso , President of the European Commission , is responsible for the current financial , economic , food and environmental crisis in which Europe finds itself .
First of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Maria Martens , who has drafted an excellent report on the progress that has been made on the agreed Africa-EU strategy .
I must emphasise the need to ensure the quality of the products sold in Europe and to guarantee the safety of those who use them .
These conclusions underline that we need to learn the lessons of the disaster in Japan and review the safety of nuclear power plants in the EU and to carry out stress tests .
This report takes a broad approach to forestry issues , focusing on some aspects that are important in our view .

Together with my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , I am deeply concerned about the limited content and way in which the Charter has been drafted .
The Financial Regulation ensures a sound system of control and is closely bound by the EEAS .
I have announced a volunteer to replace Stavros in this very important debate .
One potential and very important source for the countries of Central and Baltic States could be to use the emission of CO2 emissions under the ECJ system according to the Kyoto Protocol and thus profit from the climate resources of those countries .
Thank you .
I supported the rapporteur &apos;s proposals and the approach adopted in the Commission communication &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; , as well as the idea of an annual Single Market Forum .
However , like my fellow Members , I find it regrettable that the Council is calling into question Parliament &apos;s new decision-making powers on Parliament &apos;s long-term management plans .
I voted in favour of this report .
- Report : Paolo Costa
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to express my long-standing disappointment that , after four years , the Commission has not proposed to us a way of tightening animal transport legislation .
in writing . - ( IT ) This report is the result of a compromise , because at least 1625 amendments have been tabled to it and have been sorted out according to a number of key points concerning the causes of the crisis , starting with the speculative bubble on the property market , through unsecured banking products and the lack of European harmonisation of taxes , which have ended up not complying with the Stability and Growth Pact .
Despite this difficult situation , these funds will enable us to maintain regular cash flows , which will guarantee payment to beneficiaries during the implementation of these programmes .
I firmly believe that the tax authorities of the Member States must cooperate to cares about tax fraud .
Shahbaz Bhatti , the Minister in Pakistan &apos;s government , Salman Taseer , Governor of the Province of Penjab and Sabir Jamaldini , coordinator of the Committee on Human Rights in Pakistan - three innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic rights .
I would like to use words that also reflect positive aspects of the European Union , because - although perhaps surprisingly - positive developments have also taken place recently .
This is an important way of supporting families with children who allow them to reduce the tax burden they are subject to .
We must take them with enthusiasm and not be a small boat .
in writing . - ( LV ) European livestock farmers are currently experiencing difficulties that we all have to overcome together to enable the livestock sector to develop and provide sufficient incomes for farmers .
There are two declarations here where EU control leads to a violation of a certain principle .
Now it is proposed that the Treaty should be in force for a whole generation and should be implemented using the simplified procedure , at the request of the current authorities in the EU , in order to create a mechanism that they believe is &apos; fully in line with the policies of the International Monetary Fund &#93; &apos; .
Personally activity is extremely important for women , as it can help them to avoid unemployment or better balance their professional and family life .
in writing . - It is very important for the European Union to take action and to become a global leader in reducing carbon emissions in the run-up to the Copenhagen Summit .
It is also necessary for them to be able to participate in projects involving the post-war reconstruction of their countries .
In this way , candidates from all the countries of the IMF will be able to compete on the basis of competence , taking into account all relevant aspects .
Without this assistance , Ukraine would still not be able to fully integrate into many areas of the economy and achieve further objectives .
All the funds that are sold in the European Union will , as a result , be subject to similar regulations - much thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament .
in writing . - ( HU ) In six months , the European Union has moved from a situation of full hope to almost total breakdown .
This will damage businesses whose products are certified in one country in another by the need to resubmit to the entire certification procedure in another country .
We believe that cooperation with India is extremely important in order to bring to a successful conclusion the negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement that will enable both sides - the European Union and India - to come out of this process in a victory .
Antibiotic resistance ( debate )
The Takkula report raises an important social problem .
in writing . - A number of recent developments have shown us the importance of consumer confidence , which is partly due to proper legislation to protect consumers on the market .
I wonder whether Mrs Ashton can confirm this and also carry out an analysis of the situation ?
The Muslim lack of freedom openly supports this programme and is supported by 20 % of voters .
Of course , we have the Europe 2020 strategy , in which sustainable development is recognised as an objective in planning .
( The sitting was suspended at 13.45 and resumed at 15.00 )
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that what has happened in the Committee of the Regions was a serious and harmful violation of the rights of a Member State of the EU .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am amazed by the attitude of some Members who are talking about simplification for SMEs , but when it comes to setting the first step for micro-entities - and we are talking about that scale today - we are determined once again to say &apos; no &apos; .
I welcome the introduction of financial mechanisms to assist with the management of these waste , so that they are no longer a threat , as well as the setting up of regulatory bodies that are more demanding and preventable in infringing the provisions of this directive .
Our objective should be a total switch to renewable energy by 2050 .
We need proper implementation of the regulations in force , and I think that your comments on navigation satellite systems , etc . , are very important in this debate .
The fact that the European population is ageing is different everywhere .
As Parliament , I believe that we must strive for more dynamism in our decisions in order to respond to the problems in Europe , bearing in mind transparency in the management of funds .
It is also completely absurd and unacceptable that MEPs must ask the Commission the content of the agreements that we are to vote on behind closed doors .
I would also like to highlight the positive relationship between public and private actions , which consists both in encouraging damages to be paid to the victims and in establishing a five-year period for the application of claims .
Like the rapporteur , I view positively the efforts to consolidate financial and human resources and make internal control mechanisms more efficient in 2008 .
We can normally assess the sincerity of Russia &apos;s intentions on the basis of its commitment to resolving conflicts such as this , but the fact is that in both Transnistria and Ukraine , Russia cannot stop interfering in their affairs .
I welcome the adoption of the report by my colleague , Mr Jáuregui , on the EU &apos;s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
in writing . - By voting , Parliament has today voted in favour of changing the legal basis for the legislation on radioactive contamination of foodstuffs .
I therefore agree that we should call on the Member States to take steps to improve the situation of children left by their parents in their home country and to ensure their normal development in terms of education and social life .
The Campania region and the entire Italian state are working on the creation of a network of facilities for the disposal of waste in accordance with European law .
Above all , however , the agreement will make the market safer and more competitive .
I call for very strong intervention from the President of Parliament in order to get an answer to this attack .
The Europe we dream about is a place where freedom of expression is fundamental .
( DE ) Mr President , there have been real problems in all the countries that are experiencing the crisis .
We would insist that the Council stop putting this House in a hurry and that it should put an end to putting itself in a hurry .
I therefore support the directive , together with my group , because it represents an important step for Parliament , which will have a positive impact on the lives of the people of Europe .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the advantage of the Commission &apos;s proposal for a directive on consumer rights is that it comprises four previous directives on this subject into one legislative instrument .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs , in particular Mr Sánchez Presedo , who is socialist , and Mrs Bowles , who worked very effectively with me on the compromise text that has been tabled today as the Commission &apos;s report on the Commission &apos;s White Paper .
( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , the level of interest of the authors of this question is easy to judge on the basis that none of these questions is already present in the House , so they will hear what Mrs Inese Vaidere said just now , namely that Russian visa policy is being defended , not to strengthen the naturalisation process in Latvia , but to achieve an opposite result .
Nevertheless , I believe that the work we have done gives us cause for optimism .
In my opinion , the EU should look closely at this possibility during the forthcoming dialogue , in which the High Representative will be intermediate .
( DE ) Mr President , there are unresolved issues of European economic policy in the debate today .
In addition , the Commission &apos;s control strategy for research is aimed at ensuring due certainty as to the legality and legitimacy of spending on research over the years throughout the framework programme .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
We are witnessing attempts to manipulate the European Union &apos;s trade policy - which , unfortunately , the United Kingdom is now bound to do - to discredit a largely socialist programme that was consistently rejected .
It is important that we make it clear that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated .
Radionic and television media are the most important sources of information available to citizens in EU Member States and , as a result , they are an important factor in shaping values and opinions .
Nobody , in the world , would be able to understand this .
If people do not want to go home , they can ask their guards for political asylum .
If we do not stand in this way towards the sanction of homophobia by the state and the criminalisation of public expression by homosexual people , then what is happening here ?
This will be beneficial not only for individual entrepreneurs , but also for the competitiveness of the European market to other large economies , such as the United States , China and Japan .
You cannot exclude , prevent , foresee everything that can happen in aviation .
There has been an improvement in this area , too .
In doing so , it is based on the conclusions of the March 2010 European Council , which highlighted the need to reduce the early school leaving rate in Europe and also set a common target for reducing it to less than 10 % by 2020 .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , every year , thousands of children are trafficked and an even greater number of children are being kidnapped .
EU good governance and regional policy (
It should be remembered that GDP serves to measure production rather than , for example , environmental sustainability .
Such cooperation makes life easier for the rapporteur .
Therefore , from a political point of view , it is absolutely essential that we vote in favour of this text and , given the debates we have had , the return of Mrs Wallis and also of the part of the House by 180 degrees is completely unjustified .
This opinion is also supported by the study prepared for the Commission by the Swiss Institute for Portera and by the 2009 Schaldemose report adopted by Parliament .
( NL ) First of all , I would like to thank Mr Bowis for his very vigorous and committed efforts to public health and patient mobility and wish him a speedy recovery .
The problems in European aviation have demonstrated once again in recent days the importance of passenger and freight transport in the organisation of modern society .
Secondly , and most importantly , we voted against , because you are using the attention that should normally be made to be made to the victims in order to produce a new pocket effect on immigration : social and legal support , automatic residence card , access to the labour market , simplified access to connections between families and social care .
Furthermore , the communication sent to several governments reveals their opposition to some policies , such as tax reduction policies .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the package we are going to vote on tomorrow would never have come about without the will of the European Parliament , so I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work that has been done .
Unfortunately , however , it no longer represents a reliable point of reference for political debate , because it does not measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion .
I think it should be a matter for the G20 .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effectiveness of European agencies active in the areas of employment , working conditions and training .
The truth is that the noble idea of human rights all too often falls into deep catch and lawyers with millions of incomes will be rich in defending the unjustified rights of terrorists , criminals and greeners .
The European Parliament is today demanding that Dawit Isaak and other journalists be imprisoned in Eritrea immediately .
Madam President , honourable Members , allow me to take this opportunity to thank you for the additional EUR 10 million that Parliament has committed at the end of 2008 to the European Refugee Fund .
In this day and age , patients are increasingly looking for health information so that they can actively participate in health decisions .
They are disappointed and worried that they can be excluded from the labour market .
Without paragraph 1 , all this makes no sense - and paragraph 1 , which demands a strong and sustainable CAP with budgetary resources for the sake of ambitious objectives , makes no sense either .
the report by Loius Grech , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on bringing the Single Market closer to consumers and citizens ,
Realistic benchmarks must be set in order to increase employment , especially the employability of young people .
I think one thing is good : all sides are interested in research and know that this is the only hope for Europe and the Member States .
I would like to say that it is unfortunate that you have clearly condemned this article in the Swedish newspaper .
Action needs to be taken to stop late payment in commercial transactions in order to safeguard the good health of the European economy and not to allow production structures to face financial constraints , thereby increasing dependency on the banking sector .
It is absurd to encourage imports of products that do not even meet the quality standards imposed on our farmers .
Finally , I would like to emphasise that there are major challenges in terms of achieving unity at European level , strategic cooperation with the most important external partners , and keeping our full commitment to international climate action , but it is necessary to draw many lessons from the COP 15 .
It should therefore be based on real problems , ask important questions and focus on concrete measures to ensure added value in people &apos;s everyday lives .
Oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
Opening of the session
Once again , I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for his very constructive approach .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s amendment , which nevertheless provides for the protection of bees , which is important for farmers and for the issue of pollination .
In this way , we can encourage users to choose , in the long term , more environmentally friendly vehicles or means of transport , to use less overstretched infrastructure or to move on to other advice .
In the area of security , we are concerned about Iran &apos;s attitude and the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan .
In my opinion , we must enter into negotiations with the assumption that the best solution is to solve the problem , which requires all joint engagement .
We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are low .
On the other hand , other countries have decided - for reasons that seem to reflect their own narrow interests on applicants - to take advantage of the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of the area and try once again to keep them outside .
in writing . - ( FR ) I am delighted that we have reached an agreement on this text , which will allow slots to be frozen within the summer season .
We therefore need , for example , to examine what happened during the Detroit flight in order to try to prevent mistakes , but we must not be matched in a machinery after every attack , because this will most likely lead to the adoption of often pointless measures .
All working time for full-time mothers must be accounted for by their pension contributions , which we must ensure .
Any further malicious and unjustified political attacks will be unnecessary .
In this respect , Europe &apos;s approach should be &apos; yes , of course we need external suppliers , we need security of supply and large and innovative projects , such as Desertec , but we also need to ensure that people , businesses and households have more control over and more energy spending because of price , the economy and the environment &apos; .
That is why the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the proposals for an impact assessment and will vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr Sturdy , which I have signed , on endocrine disrupters and on ensuring the availability of plant protection products in emergency cases .
It is scandalous that some hardworking countries are still having to pay for the mistakes of others .
For some time , Europe has been giving financial support to this region : EUR 1 billion a year for Afghanistan , EUR 300 million per year for Pakistan , a EUPOL mission , which is doing invaluable work despite the problems of personnel , the international election observation mission and , of course , the involvement of the various countries in the ISAF mission .
That is one thing .
Another measure that is needed is for India to draw up and implement transparent , clear public procurement rules that will also enable European companies to gain access to them .
Thus , it will be easier to achieve long-term strategic projects in order to achieve a stronger EU by means of a proper impact assessment and by setting out the different legal options , as well as by having clear objectives and funding for the financing of European infrastructure .
As part of this process , the ratification of the new START Treaty , which is yet to take place in the US Congress , is part of the new START Treaty .
It is becoming increasingly mobile and the final analysis suggests that organised crime is increasingly associated with cyber crime .
I also think , as has been said , that we have made it clear what aspects are being criticised and what group supervision are at stake .
I am committed to cooperating with the new President of the European Council , because such a partnership will make a difference .
However , there is also a positive aspect , since the report provides for the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers who are sent back to the consular authorities and international organisations in order to prevent illegal immigration and facilitate the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
Now people can rightly claim that the Brandenburg Brotherhood has become a gateway of freedom .
Firstly , this communication defines ways of improving the situation in the European Union as regards good governance in the field of taxation , in order to strengthen the arguments that would convince other jurisdictions to follow the EU &apos;s lead .
I spoke at the beginning of my speech about a difficult choice , and the Commission knows what roads it wants to follow .
However , it is clear that if the two main parties in the country do not leave their minds , this objective will never be achieved .
In my opinion , Parliament &apos;s contribution is all the more important because , in the current situation , the Member States are being forced to make difficult choices and I believe that research and innovation must be protected as investments in the future , and I can assure the Council of the content of this debate and I will be at your disposal .
We should , with honour , recognise the right of democracy and the highest authority of the parliament in each of the 27 Member States .
I am also convinced that we must pursue a policy of zero tolerance in respect of human rights and democratisation and expect high standards to be met .
( RO ) Mr President , this regulation marks a step forward in progressively reaching the objective of reducing CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles in Europe .
We can see that this strategy is one of the greatest strategic achievements in Europe .
Special protection should be given to the most vulnerable groups to unethical practices , such as children , young people or older people .
With these reservations , I welcome the services of micro-credits in Poland , which are open to them .
It is up to the Egyptian authorities to take immediate action to stop torture , to investigate all cases of harassment of peaceful demonstrators and to bring an end to trials against civilians before military courts .
There are even cases where there are different national systems in one country .
So the answer is more democracy , not more of the politics of extreme right-wing , hostile to and cynical contempt peoples .
It is naive to put the hopes of a database covering the whole of the EU , together with its different languages and IT systems , when the failed attempt to create a health database in the UK alone has meant that the GBP billion would be wasted .
In October 2010 , the Commission adopted a communication entitled &apos; The Single Market Act &apos; in order to revitalise the Single Market .
In view of legal certainty and predictability , the EU must now develop an effective , transparent dispute settlement mechanism available to all investors , including the smallest ( new ) .
Such a proposal for a tax at EU level is incompatible with the constitution .
We need a plan B , as has rightly been said , and the alternative is the rail system .
I would like to express our gratitude to the European Parliament for the additional EUR 3 million , within the framework of the EU budget for 2008 , earmarked for the rebuilding of cultural heritage on affected areas of the Western Balkans .
In addition , Member States must ensure that all return actions are carried out in accordance with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which imposes an obligation on Member States to ensure that , when a person is returned , he or she will probably be exposed to persecution or serious attack .
This will enable you to be more effective than to use the opt-out clause and allow the separate functioning of the various funds .
It is absolutely vital that , in the process of defining legislation at EU level , we be aware of the huge exposure of women and children in cases of domestic violence .
I hope that , once the 26 elected assemblies , the representatives of the administration will not stop the democratic process by refusing to sign the signature .
Iceland &apos;s 2010 progress report
There are also significant differences in the approach to the crime of violence in the various Member States .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
For me , the key issue is to raise the level of public awareness , and I believe that these reports will help us achieve this .
The next item is voting time .
It must be understood that we are going through a period of transformation from an intergovernmental approach to a Community approach , and I am pleased that this is true of internal affairs and justice .
We must not forget that the most important thing is efforts for the sake of the child .
Instead of removing micro-entities completely from the fourth directive , it is necessary to clearly lay down the requirements that are reduced and to include them within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives .
When the military war escalation takes place to the extent that the international institutions are no longer safe , the situation is becoming extremely serious .
This report contains important conclusions : improving the way in which information is gathered at local and regional level ; improving the way in which patients are informed ; more specialised nurses in controlling infections ; the system of incentives for education and training for health professionals ; and greater focus on health-care infections .
Ireland has now decided to hold a second referendum .
I welcome the initiative of the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , in which we call on the European Union to officially recognise the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis and their allies against the Roma people during the Second World War , as it marks a step forward in the fight to defend the rights of the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , this is not the first time that our fellow Member , Mr Cohn-Bendit , has called the President - Prime Minister - a dictator such as Hugo Chavez , does not respect democracy .
The Tobin Tax is one of the models of the financial transaction tax that has been proposed .
It is high time for national poverty , discrimination and marginalisation still affects a large number of Roma across Europe , so it is high time to achieve improvements in this regard .
It is the responsibility of the public to guarantee this freedom of choice and not to discriminate against any activity simply because it does not fall typically into the formal labour market .
In 30 years , my career of professional accounting and audit career has never met audited auditors how to do their work .
It is good that Parliament is paying greater attention to the application and transposition of the legislation that we are adopting here .
I am thinking here of abolishing customs duties on textiles from Pakistan , which would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Lombardy and throughout Europe .
Composition of committees : see Minutes
All the radical changes taking place in European rural areas mean challenges in terms of population , jobs , services and the environment .
It is therefore essential to strengthen and develop specific and jointly agreed cooperation and , at the same time , to adapt it to the new challenges of international relations .
I expect Copenhagen to provide us with sustainable commitments , short- and medium-term verification , together with cash punishments if these commitments are not met .
The delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party ( PVV ) therefore voted against and advocates that the costs of all unjustified losses should be borne in charge .
I ask these questions because I strongly doubt whether we Europeans are in the process of dealing with the situation , although I welcome the solidarity measures adopted at the meeting on 11 February .
In future generations , children will be talking about history about Europe being divided long ago , it was a great wall by its own means , and its own people in the East were very poor , they did not have democracy and lived in a bad communism system that killed millions of its own citizens .
Let me remind you that the Polish Parliament has agreed to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon in April this year , but the ratification documents have still not been completed by the President .
I agree with its assessment of the Commission &apos;s proposal , and I would like to add a few observations about the importance of such actions .
The next item is the debate on :
The most important thing is the start of negotiations , and Parliament is ready for this .
We believe that the accusations being made against these people are unfounded and I can assure you that we will continue to work with the Iranian authorities in all possible ways until these issues have been successfully resolved , i.e. until they have been released .
Jobbik ( the move for better Hungary ) would like to put an end to the economic fabric of monopolies of multinationals and to bring Europe to small-scale owners and family companies , so that we can eliminate unemployment in the European Community with their help .
in writing . - As recommended by the Committee on Civil Liberties , I voted against the draft decision .
The fifth challenge is the further development of Frontex , and the challenge is to improve procedures , conventions and agreements with the countries of origin and transit , while the Seventh is striving for progress in the area of a common asylum policy .
The Irish &apos; yes &apos; gives us certainty that the Treaty of Lisbon will enter into force ; this is certain , as the last obstacle has been cleared .
Emphasis has been given to employment , as there is a risk that economic recovery will not be accompanied by the rebuilding of jobs .
The European Union must be a model , both in terms of tightening up the rules and in terms of solidarity efforts .
Between 14 June and 14 October 2010 , 1 336 redundancies were made , while another 1 498 redundancies were made before and after that period .
It is a question of completing this work and submitting a report on the outcome of the negotiations at the June Council .
in writing . - The financial crisis of 2008 has clearly highlighted the need for the European Supervisory Authority to coordinate financial sector supervision and supervision in the European Union .
For example , we recall research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme , particularly those implemented involving the Israeli space industry , which produced unmanned aircraft used in the attack on the Gaza Strip 2008-2009 , in which dozens of people lost their lives .
( LT ) Minister , thank you for the actions that Belgium , as the presiding country , has undertaken to combat poverty .
I agree that , without a global agreement , all our efforts will be in vain .
I would like to quote one akapis in the draft Commission statement annexed to the proposal .
The three reports in question maintain the spirit and far-sightedness that we have seen in the new strategy of Professor Mario Monti for the Single Market ; they are perfectly expressing their intention of working in unison to relaunch the European Single Market through 50 measures that Parliament then transforming into synthesis and distributing its centres to 14 priorities .
The governments of the Gulf States respond in different ways : through appropriate financial packages to meet the most pressing needs , including the social policies , with some legislative powers for selected bodies , or through openness to comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue .
Regarding the arguments put forward by Mr Ziobra , the problem of interfering the Strasbourg Court in the competence of the Union does not exist .
I would like to ask you to reconsider all these issues during the negotiations on reforming the POSEI programme .
in writing . - I would like to join in the debate in acknowledging the courage shown by the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples in their discontent and disappointment .
So I simply do not understand why we cannot take a similar approach from this point of view .
The European Union has introduced legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to those workers who have been hit by the negative consequences of far-reaching structural changes in world trade and to help them re-enter the labour market .
The broad scope of the final text and the protection of consumer rights are the result of its negotiating skills .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to establish the requirement for EU Member States to report annually to the Commission on the activities of their ECAs with regard to risk calculations and on the disclosure of off-balance-sheet instruments , as well as on social and environmental risk calculations .
Mrs Rondra , please sit down and stop speaking .
This is a very important fact , demonstrating Parliament &apos;s will and ability to present its candidacy to play a central role in CFSP and CSDP policies on the basis of what I call the Treaty of Lisbon &apos;s dynamic reading .
I therefore generally support this report , provided that Member States maintain a leading position in the management and protection of wilderness areas .
Above all , from our months of work , I wish that this House can see how the EEAS shares the shape it represents and how well it serves .
That concludes this item .
Other issues should be raised at the summit .
It goes without saying that Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity must be preserved .
So you can see that we have almost the same level .
That is why this debate is important ; it reminds you that this year , in 2009 , the Commission committed itself to submitting a communication to this House in order to assess possible European threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information and to the importance of drafting a directive guaranteeing the pluralism of information , taking into account new technologies and television in particular .
The effective implementation of this directive and the completion of the shortcomings identified in the transposition and application of earlier directives would be to complement protection against discrimination against the European Union &apos;s citizens .
I therefore support the adoption of this report because it highlights the importance of European political parties , as necessary participants in the political life of the EU , and puts forward concrete proposals aimed at creating secure and transparent conditions for the functioning and funding of European political parties .
So , if we want to achieve the objectives set here every week , we need an ambitious budget , and that means no less money for the future .
Yanukovich was the President as a result of the winning democratic elections , albeit by a narrow majority .
At a time when the effects of the recession and public debt crisis are being hit hard , we need strong economic governance at EU level .
The joint debate is closed .
The rapporteur considers that all the conditions for abolishing border controls with Bulgaria and Romania have been met , but demands that the European Parliament be informed of the additional measures to be taken at the Bulgaria-Turkey-Turkey border , which are one of the most vulnerable borders on illegal immigration .
I am pleased to say that the regulation on passenger rights has been very important in order to provide security measures , which will ensure that it is not passengers who bear the financial burden of cancelled flights that are not left in chaos .
As in 2004 , the Council Presidency will be asked to select a candidate for this important post from one of the main groups in the European Parliament , and on 15 July our Parliament will give its opinion on the candidate , one of the first major political tasks of the next parliamentary term .
We must ask all political forces to put an end to this crisis , because the alternative is Albania &apos;s isolation and its European prospects under threat .
I supported this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
I also insist that we demand the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba and in all other corners of the world , but I still advise you to take action which have proved to be inadequate in terms of progress towards democracy and liberalisation , such as the embargo and the blockade .
In view of the people of Sri Lanka , I would like the expression I have heard so many times - &apos; war is an institution &apos; - to finally go down in the past .
The public is very sensitive to unnecessary practices that bring suffering and are completely opposed to it .
Secondly , if we are serious about achieving a level of up to 95 % by 2050 , the road map by 2020 needs to be reduced by at least 30 % .
The industry concerned and , in particular , the groups of investors , have , in general , confirmed this need , but for three years since the implementation of the MiFID , the market participants have been unable to work together on tools for consolidated registration of transactions .
We also need to give powers to the regulatory authorities so that they can ensure that these rights are exercised properly .
Like Vice-President Tajani , I , too , would like to express my warm and gratitude for the important work carried out by Commissioner Barrot and for the good will shown by the French Presidency .
The European Parliament lost its way out of us , but the Swedish Presidency certainly earned it .
Europe must ensure that we use energy in a much more effective way .
Their aim is to buy goods and services with the best relationship between prices and quality .
Nevertheless , we Swedish Social Democrats welcome the fact that , ultimately , you have taken account of the demands that we and Parliament are making to include the rights of women and children more fully in the programme .
It is clear that there are various changes in the Member States .
So the reality is different from those of the organisations .
( FR ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s resolution shows that our institution in this area , as well as many others , has absolutely no authority whatsoever with regard to the dogmas we have .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Van Rompuy , ladies and gentlemen , I can see two main problems with the proposed revision of Article 136 .
It is therefore a step in the right direction .
In any case , I do not agree with the link between the fight against HIV and such a sensitive problem as abortion .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . - ( LV ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to the 2007 annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy , I would like to highlight a number of issues that are important for the Committee on Budgets .
Finally , the essence of this report reveals the fact that it does not make any reference to anti-democratic decisions and accusations against citizens , such as the ban on the Communist parties and other organisations , and the imprisonment of Communists and other militants in the EU Member States in Central Europe and the Baltic States .
( The President of the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , the European External Action Service is the result of one of the most important decisions in connection with the Treaty of Lisbon .
We must break the policy of free trade , we must abandon the freedom of movement of capital , we must support food sovereignty , we must recognise water and energy as global public goods , and we must combat socio-economic inequalities .
firstly , the future of farming in the Community must also be certain after 2013 ;
From my point of view , the question arises as to whether this will happen within the framework of existing projects , which are already financed from cohesion funds or within the framework of new projects .
That is why we have to say that , following today &apos;s speech by President Mubarak , following the government &apos;s speech , and after smoking , we will shoulder to shoulder with these people .
Today , I would like to thank Mr Borrell and Mr Pöttering and the Committee on Petitions for supporting Michael &apos;s fight for justice .
I therefore voted against this report .
In my opinion , the binding objective for the EU and Portugal is more beneficial than a loss .
In order to earn the same as an average of a man in the course of a year , women must , on average , work by the end of next February , a total of 418 days .
They have been systematically discriminated against and intimidated and killed for decades , and their identity is under threat .
This report concerns the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I , too , would like to thank the Commissioner for coming here today to explain more precisely what powers she has asked for .
The key issue of reforming the international monetary system has been ignored .
Human rights should be the main area of concern for them .
Thanks to this , such companies would no longer have any reason to take illegal action .
( CS ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the EU &apos;s common visa policy is currently facing a huge problem , which is the visa requirement applied by Canada for 10 months for the citizens of the Czech Republic .
The European Medicines Agency plays an important role as a preferred source of objective information .
I have received a motion for amendments to the vote today : following yesterday &apos;s meeting of President Jerzy Buzek with Prime Minister Zapatero , it was agreed that there should be an immediate dialogue on certain procedural aspects concerning the Council &apos;s discharge .
Subject : Alps by the Alps railway line
If we were in the Senate in ancient Rome , there would certainly be a senator in the wagon and asked Mr Trichet : &apos; Quousque tantantandem , Trichete , Patients ? &apos; - how long will you continue to abuse our patience , Mr Trichet ?
Finally , Mr President , if you allow me to address all the suspicions that may arise , I would like to propose that we establish an investigation committee for the European Parliament on this matter .
The service concessions have been deliberately excluded from the scope of the public procurement directives in order to ensure greater flexibility in these areas and to take account of cultural differences .
I agree with some of the other ideas that have been set out , but I think it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and comprehensible .
I believe that this network can be of great importance , but it is not functioning effectively at the moment and does not make use of all its potential .
It is , of course , true that EPAs differ from the Lomé Convention and the Cotonou Agreement , which established the Union &apos;s relations with the ACP countries for 30 years , but the unilateral preferences provided for in these acts have been challenged by other developing countries within the World Trade Organisation .
However , while we fully support the integration of Roma in the European Union , we have serious doubts about the European Union &apos;s commitment to matters that we believe fall under the competence of individual nation states , such as access to healthcare , education , employment and housing .
It is also necessary to give priority to food security , agriculture , infrastructure , capacity building , economic growth that fosters social power , access to technology , as well as social development in the least developed countries .
It is no longer possible to drag on any more .
The ultimate aim is to improve the implementation of EU legislation that will ensure that animals improve their health and decent living conditions .
What action will you take to encourage rich countries to take part in the cost of this crisis ?
We also need good practice , because for example , Slovenia is following the vehicles that travel through its territory .
It is also important for these solutions to be beneficial to our citizens , not only today and tomorrow , but also to safeguard the future of our children .
If we want to avoid closing the fishery , we must keep the rate of exploitation at 30 % .
Here , we have an urgent priority .
Cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing the productivity gap caused by the crisis , but also to restoring efficiency .
This is a very important issue for all EU citizens and how the Commission and Parliament will deal with it will be an important testament to accountability and transparency .
In conclusion , I would like to emphasise that all the non-standard measures that we have taken in the period of great financial tension are temporary and have been drafted in the exit strategy .
This report is frightening with regard to the activities of this Parliament .
the smooth organisation of projects , the effective use of funds and the clear definition of the duration of their resources ;
At the moment , that is not possible and , as you said , they are in danger .
I would like to begin by emphasising that I support any Turkish efforts and efforts to democratise the country .
The Commission &apos;s proposal expands the concept of micro-entities and defines them as companies which , for a day , meet two of the following criteria : their sum does not exceed EUR 500 000 , net turnover amounts to over EUR 1 million , the average number of employees in the financial year does not exceed 10 people .
However , we must fulfil our commitment to climate change : everyone recognises that we are global leaders in this regard .
rapporteur . - Madam President , you have taken me a little because I have not noticed the total revision of today &apos;s agenda , but I am grateful for being able to address the big House on such an important issue as the financial services sector , that is , the insurance and reinsurance sector , and the way in which we have got to know what the Solvency II report was going to set out in the entire European Union .
Therefore , it is absolutely necessary to go to 30 % , and I would like to conclude by recalling the words of President Obama , who said that we can abandon future jobs for our competitors or take advantage of the centuries , as they have already done .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to address four points .
For this reason , I have allowed myself , along with a number of other MEPs , to invite a expert to participate in the debate tomorrow , which examines the phenomenon of the illegal trafficking of organs and the default killings committed against Chinese citizens for transplantation .
President-in-Office of the Council , we would like to thank you for a very constructive and comprehensive report and we wish you good luck .
These initiatives , supported by the EC funds , allow us to cooperate specifically on specific projects and programmes , combining the forces of all the institutions , and as such are an excellent field for coordinating and developing our joint work .
- ( SK ) Once again , we have a problem with respect for the rights of ethnic minorities in Slovakia and with the fault of the Minister for Education , a member of the extremely nationalist governing party .
In view of the necessary safeguards , such as the possibility for European citizens to lodge administrative appeals and to guarantee the same treatment as American citizens , as well as the data retention camps , cooperation between Europe and the United States is , in this case , a suitable compensation for the negative effects of globalisation .
The EIB can and must play an important role in managing current events in the Mediterranean region .
I therefore support the proposal for an investigation into the division of margins between production and distribution chains .
However , when we constantly put the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle first - and I am ready to discuss it with you - then it should be the Member States that are responsible for congestion because they do not provide sufficient infrastructure .
The first is the loans for student mobility .
However , it is important that we are aware that , although the problem mainly concerns poverty in southern Europe , we have the chance to increase the empathy and link citizens to what Europe means : added value in response .
Today , Europe is losing momentum , even though it has a higher percentage of educated people than countries with greater success , such as China and India .
We therefore need a more coherent and better Europe , more united and ambitious .
I am sure that they are a step in the right direction .
The Greek Communist Party opposes and voted against the amendments that adapt the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to make the following observation : it is very surprising that , at a time when the growth rate for Albania is steadily in progress and growth in 2010 , with global instability , exceeds 2 % , and it is predicted to reach 3 % in 2011 , social tension rather than decreasing .
Human trafficking is still an important problem within the European Union , too .
There are other matters that I would like to highlight in relation to what Mr Paparisov said .
In Southern Sudan , the EU is making a serious contribution to stability , development and institutional building .
As you said , the Sri Lankan Constitution needs an amendment 13.
Of course - and I repeat this - there may be differences of opinion ; indeed , there are differences of opinion between the Commission and the Council , as well as between some Members of this House in relation to the regulation of waterway transport , and there are some who would have liked separate legislation for slaughter and maritime transport .
I support the justification of this proposal , namely , that a coherent and complete framework should be established for developing energy infrastructure investments within the Union , allowing the Commission to monitor the development of the energy sector &apos;s investments .
The start was encouraging : a global consensus on equality between women and men in all its aspects has been reached in 1995 , in political , economic , legal and social terms .
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the rule of law and democracy are fully adhered to and that there are continuous corruption in Serbia and that the people who use their office are subjected to severe penalties .
Another reason is that this team has been elected to fulfil this programme following a strategy that will not bring the necessary changes in political orientation in terms of ensuring greater social justice , job creation and poverty eradication , and which contains dangerous elements which will exacerbate these serious problems .
It is important to inform our citizens of the EU &apos;s actions in terms of democracy and legitimacy .
We , Germany , would not be entirely pleased if we did not see it as a contribution to Europe in the wake of the historic events that I have just mentioned .
In other words , Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner do the same .
As I said here in this House on a previous occasion , I stand before you as one that will gladly see a Europe of cooperating nations .
- Report : Elles
In the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats abstained .
Furthermore , the obligation to include in the register for all lobbyists who wish to have permanent access to Parliament and the Commission is an important step towards greater transparency in their relations between the organisations and the European institutions .
However , if we adopt everything at first reading , Parliament will deprive itself of its rights .
This is a very important step which will enable the fundamental rights of European Union citizens to be enforced more effectively .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the next few weeks , we will be voting on the Kirilov report , which I am pleased that we are in urgent need .
Personally , I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation , because it is businesses , small and big , that buy most commercial vehicles , and they are already well aware of the need for economic accounts and savings in fuel .
I propose a study of consolidated reports .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to make a general comment and then to ask two or three questions , depending on how long I can say .
We must also remember that , if Turkey is within the European Union , countries such as Iraq , Iran and Syria will find themselves at our borders .
I think we finally need to understand that it is not possible to talk about economic policy without ever bearing in mind the parameters of employment .
What would we expect from the EU ?
We must not forget that , of every decision we have taken , we are accounted for by our constituents , who are currently struggling .
However , for the same reason , they are also potentially an incredibly distorting trading if their financial operations are not framed within the framework of common rules .
In my opinion , the smooth management of the Single Market is only possible on condition for access to good quality , up-to-date information on how it works .
in writing . - ( ET ) In these times of global crisis ( that is , economic recession and rising unemployment ) , it is becoming a fact that , in the EU labour market , more and more people will lose their jobs , which will further increase the number of people affected by poverty and exclusion in Europe .
Of course , they have already had a flag and anthem , but they have begun to build a new state .
To a certain extent , these issues are covered by corporate social responsibility , but they cannot be implemented without a national framework .
It is a real compromise .
Furthermore , it is necessary to provide proper operational support in the event of an accident that provides passengers with the services and goods they need most .
The Council is approving the joint draft and the President of the European Parliament can see the budget as finally adopted .
The creation of mechanisms for private financing and the introduction of more frequent public-legal initiatives in order to strengthen the European resettlement programme .
At the same time , however , we want to eliminate misleading advertising from the Internet , which encourages people to buy products that not only do not care but even harm patients .
on behalf of the Verts / AL.E. - ( FR ) Mr President , I would like to make an oral amendment to this amendment , which deletes two pieces of the amendment , specifically the words &apos; by Colombia &apos; and &apos; Colombia &apos; .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe .
Madam President , once again , I think this is one of those reports that many people welcome .
Once again , we need to draw attention to the significant delays between the occurrence of the natural disaster , the EUSF decision and the actual delivery of EU support to the Member States and regions affected .
We must have proof , and that is why we have asked the French Government to provide documentation on these people .
Europe cannot simply be the sum of 27 national interests .
Meanwhile , Prime Minister Reinfeldt is reporting on the European Council &apos;s half-year activities .
The austerity measures which will lead to the jobs being lost in the public sector of hardworking people must be translated into more opportunities for companies starting up , taking advantage of the spirit of enterprise , by reducing the cost of starving up businesses so that they can create a viable private sector that is necessary to bring all our countries out of the collapse at the moment .
Two actors have been unable to develop a common vision , which has resulted in a halt to development .
In fact , does this free trade agreement ultimately only corresponds to the current situation in the world and only serves to divide the economic influence between Europe and India - the one we know today - or will it be present for 10 or 15 years ?
The main objective of the radio spectrum policy programme is broadband coverage by 2013 for the Union as a whole and access to the Internet with rapid connections by 2020 .
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the crisis covering the whole world , but is due , first of all , to the lack of immediate action at a time when this crisis broke out in the Republic of Moldova .
European workers and poor people must mobilise their forces against this soft policy and contribute to a truly democratic and socialist Europe , which means opposing the policy of this new Commission .
The European Parliament defends its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
The requirements for animal welfare have been officially incorporated into the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when formulating policies in sectors such as the internal market .
It is mainly at the level of the regions and their cultural heritage , a value that will be taken into account and highlighted in the context of regional development policy .
I think we should focus on this .
You will need all your skills of persuasion to give the EU a new impetus to international trade policy .
In fact , the reserve is the method of &apos; White Paper &apos; , which should be applied to all the emergencies that may arise during this budgetary year .
Let us observe a minute &apos;s silence in memory of Tunisian friends .
Many errors and one blame for the soapbox : the euro .
Bearing in mind the initiatives that I have just described , I believe that we now have a solid basis for improving the fishing and aquaculture sectors through innovative research that is part of the framework programme .
Today &apos;s debate is as technocratic as possible .
I therefore congratulate Mr Millán Mon on his excellent report , which comes at such an ideal time to strengthen relations between the two continents .
That is why we have proposed a significant simplification of EU legislation .
Unfortunately , important amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have been rejected , with the result that non-EU citizens of a given Member State are not able to sign up to , excluding equal participation of residents regardless of their nationality , and there is no guarantee that signatures will agree with the number of identity documents of signatories .
I call for the appointment of an independent committee composed of local and international legal experts who would investigate and prosecute the violent events following the summer of the summer elections in December 2007 .
NATO &apos;s credibility and what we call the West also depends to a large extent on what we will achieve in Afghanistan .
Things went too far and this process should be stopped .
An effective measure to improve regional policy would be to draw up guidelines for public and private actors and to establish a training programme and support mobility , with a view to providing information on the practical application of policies in the field of multi-level governance .
I hope that our Spanish and Italian colleagues will join it , but we cannot wait any longer because the whole world is in favour of an innovative market .
Furthermore , I believe that we have a duty to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies , starting with the next reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , meet these requirements accordingly .
Mr President , the ongoing negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement between the Union and Vietnam must also take into account respect for civil rights and freedoms .
Irrespective of the adoption of some important measures proposed in the report , I would like to draw attention to an essential part of this problem .
However , this method will not affect the economy and jobs on the rise in bureaucracy , unequal competition or unexpected price volatility .
This change will not have a negative impact on cod stocks , because the current subsidy is very small .
The proposed penalties are proportionate and necessary , and so the hope is to discourage trade operators from applying incorrect commercial practices .
In my opinion , given that most families , including Portugal , live in shelter areas , the criterion is unreasonable and discriminatory .
It is an instrument for measuring poverty , based on principles that are ruthless and purely financial , without taking into account the diversity of the 27 Member States , which can be summarised as simple solvency .
Consequently , both Official Development Assistance and new financial resources will be needed .
The ethical display of this project has been positive , and this is confirmed .
In my opinion , the proposed 75 % cofinancing is too high .
Ladies and gentlemen , I will clarify two things .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Commissioner for paying attention to the Tunisian problem .
Above all , the rapporteur regrets the fact that citizens are not aware of what rights they would enjoy .
The creation of an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union , and certainly the example of the European model of democracy we create , is important to all of us , and although many of us consider Europol to be an instrument that can be adapted , we nevertheless attach great importance to the collection of resources - especially human resources - and to the technical fight against organised crime and all kinds of illegal trade - with the utmost legal certainty :
It is therefore essential to adopt measures that can increase the guarantee of independence and transparency of impact assessments , thereby maximising the role of this instrument as support for decision making and as a guarantee of the quality and adequacy of the activities of the EU institutions .
My second point is that our strategy should strengthen the EU &apos;s internal cohesion , in other words its convergence .
I can add that this is not the direction in which the Commission was heading , because with the regulation adopted by this House , its proposal concentrated on reforming the current system of agencies , which are private , and on the very stringent consolidation of transparency requirements in order to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure the integrity of their lending .
At the same time , the rapporteur calls on the European Commission to produce an assessment of the costs and benefits deriving from the creation of a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation .
Even before the crisis we are experiencing now , the Member States of the European Union have been confronted with the social problems caused by the low economic growth , the complex demographic situation and the poverty in an increasingly globalised economy .
However , there are motives that are causing concern , with the risk that enthusiasm will gradually disappear .
In this Parliament , we always have a strong line in defending the rights of the people of Tibet to autonomy , which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence .
Although the directive will soon see the light of day , I and my fellow Members have voted in favour of a resolution that defines the direction in which Parliament should take on this matter .
In this context , it is important to introduce a system for monitoring and controlling medicines which will provide accurate information for the patient .
It is worth fighting for this , and that is what I am going to do .
There are some exceptions to the collection of these costs , provided that the Member States which apply for them have an important reason to do so .
This framework decision should not lead to excessive bureaucracy if better options are available for resolving the problem .
The Bank did not anticipate the emergence of a serious crisis and did not make a special distinction in its control , so it did not show itself in particular .
However , as a serious organisation , the European Union should be better prepared for such cases and , in particular , to react effectively in emergency cases .
- Report : Kaczmarek
We should therefore only support such a listing of tuna in the list if these measures prove to be ineffective .
I have committed myself to informing the European institutions of this civil protest .
The EU and the group of industrialised countries should adopt the target of a 25 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and strive , in the long term , to reduce emissions by 80 % by 2050 compared to 1999 .
Report : Maria do Céu Patrão Neves
I would like to comment in more detail on two issues that have been raised several times during the debate .
First of all , on behalf of the Council , I would like to express my thanks and to the European Parliament for its cooperation and the spirit of compromise that has allowed us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of bus and coach passengers in the EU , in particular , for people with disabilities and reduced mobility .
One of the causes is our fragmented market in defence equipment .
Even at the beginning of this period , the topic of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy was an important one .
The creation of the EEAS will require a number of decisions to be made , possibly involving changes to the Financial Staff Regulations and Regulations , both of which are one and the other require the Commission &apos;s proposal and adopted in the codecision procedure .
We fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to ensure the right balance of resources .
in writing . - The situation throughout North Africa is indeed dangerous , but it is a cause for hope at the same time .
Coordination requires continuous improvement and the responsibility of the Member States in this area must certainly be increased .
With the firm voice of the Irish people , we are in the spirit and gave us the strength to further develop and build a strong and , above all , federal Europe .
Although environmental and public health go hand in hand , I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers .
This is a fraction that we must resolve together .
We need to work with the countries that are the largest consumers of timber , such as the United States , China , Russia and Japan , to solve this problem and establish a global system of alerts to illegal logging and the countries that give rise to fears , including interpol and the relevant United Nations body , which exploits the most recent satellite technologies .
Of course , we cannot allow short-term support for the sector to be hit by its long-term competitiveness .
I would also like to say that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
In view of the effects of the current economic and social crisis , the fight against unemployment and social exclusion is a particular concern for the European public and the European institutions .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to say that I think that this subject is too important for us to continue to live in the lie that Europe is living through .
We did not know , of course , as has already been said , the names of the candidates , and we did not have a candidate - although we have to recognise to Commissioner Barnier that he has clarified this with conviction .
We are talking about the low turnout in the European elections and the number of &apos; no &apos; votes in European referendums .
We will have to find out what is going on and then we will inform you , Mr Coelho .
( PL ) Mr President , horizontal agreements include a very wide range of regulations , and regulatory failures - whether deliberately or unintended - can lead to the elimination of competition .
We also need a more effective and better common European asylum system .
This is the end of the oral questions .
I am also aware that you are all prepared to support a form of police cooperation that respects human rights and respects the values of the European Union .
In his work , Guerka Picasso turned the same exaggeration into exaggeration , presenting our Guernica equals to the ground by the junkersa Legion Condor seven years ago .
In this sense , speculators are also trying to speculate in a poor economic situation , often exacerbating it even more .
Mr Bové is right and Mr Fajmon is deeply ...
We must promote not only competitiveness , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution , ensuring the diversity of agriculture throughout Europe .
in writing . - The Bernhard Rapkay report on changes to the Staff Regulations in the context of the creation of the European External Action Service - EEAS is a very important document in the direction of creating the Union &apos;s foreign policy .
We therefore believe , and we will debate this again at first reading , that initial expenditure is a reflection of our priority and we agree with the rapporteur on the issue of multilingualism and buildings , something that has always been an important priority for us , but in terms of pressure on legislation .
A few weeks ago , I had the honour of chairing a delegation from the Committee on International Trade in Parliament at the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva .
With this in mind , Europe will be able to move forward with a highly injured tangle .
I asked the Member States to provide me with a proposal of names , including women .
Firstly , it is necessary to maintain the geographical distribution of Union financial assistance from the Union budget between the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries in accordance with the provisions of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective and to continue lending support for these countries from the European Investment Bank .
We believe that Kosovo is a unique case and we would like to point out that it was not recognised by Spain and four other Member States .
This is a sufficient reason why , according to appeals from the Belarusian opposition , we should not invite Alexander Lukashenko to the summit of the Union .
This is a very important approach : to distinguish between the truly humanist and holistic elements of our policies , even with regard to the internal market .
Mr President , I would like to express my support for the words of my fellow Members on the rights of people with disabilities during the journey , for words by Mrs Kadenbach on children , on fire-fighting safety in hotels and , above all , on the safety of the EU hotel installations and on the need to create a proposal that will be examined in the future .
I , too , intended to ask the issue of gender balance , and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on his appointment .
It is clear from this report that national defence and security issues are a matter for the Member States , which we believe needs to be emphasised .
Similarly , those Member States that have been most concerned about the prospect of asset stripping and hidden takeovers have not set lower thresholds , which have resulted in the obligation to issue divisions or the obligation to report contracts on various transactions .
Furthermore , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Lehne , for his approach to this matter .
In other words , the Copenhagen Accord refers to the level of ambition that is necessary to tackle the climate change problem within the framework of the post-2012 climate agreement and provides the basis for the financial package and encourages serious commitments to reduce emissions .
AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis take almost four million lives every year .
To be precise , from a trade perspective , I would like to ask the Commissioner to ensure that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) is not used to impede the sale of medicines at more competitive prices , safe generic medicines that do not violate copyright and whose only crime is that they are produced in the emerging countries , for example , in India and in the East Islam .
Finally , MEPs have the right to express their opinions .
This is unacceptable .
We want to engage in this .
That is why we will have to find the right level of financial and technological compensation .
It is also an area where we can take more decisive action within the framework of competition and consumer policy .
It is also a disgrace that these politicians want us to accept the result of our second referendum , even though they did not actually accept the result of the first referendum themselves .
As a co-author of the European Parliament resolution on Kyrgyzstan , I would like to express my thanks to the colleagues who voted in favour of this document today .
Mr President , Minister , I would like to conclude by mentioning the suggestion to future generations .
It is absolutely necessary to establish clear rules and objectives in the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) in order to consolidate the internal market permanently and improve environmental quality in the European Union , as well as in order to recover strategic raw materials .
The Heads of State or Government have also emphasised that nuclear safety cannot be limited to the European Union and that we will also ask our neighbours to participate in these stress tests .
It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the role of military forces and the role of humanitarian aid providers , with a view to establishing dialogue between military bodies and humanitarian organisations , thereby encouraging mutual understanding .
Work is currently under way in the Commission on a more systematic assessment of the quality of developments in the field of public finances , taking into account aspects of the budget based on results .
That will be my priority as Trade Commissioner .
Therefore , depending on the situation , the Commission can submit amended or new proposals .
The United States still has clear , transparent criteria for refusing visas in some Member States .
The question of funding remains open .
I now say to the rest of this House : Turkey &apos;s constructive criticism is needed ; we are ourselves critical friends .
Studies show that profits from trafficking in human beings exaggerate and trade in drugs .
Farmers in my own region of the world feel completely disappointed and severely infected by the fact that they are being assumed here that they do not know what they are doing and they have to say so .
No .
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution ; by acknowledging the negative impact of market liberalisation on the local economy , it stresses the strategic importance of sound tariff protection .
At the end of the day , I am voting in favour of the proposal in this report , which is aimed at repairing the European economy by providing greater financial support for energy projects .
The report on the European Refugee Fund is all the more incomprehensible in its message .
These estimates can increase .
In order to highlight the value of household work , economists use mathematical models .
Only when we are fully informed about such matters can we talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law .
I repeat : absolutely not .
It is also urgent , especially in the run-up to the Copenhagen conference , that the EU and other international players clearly establish their policies on international trade , climate change , humanitarian aid and development .
Nigeria is a very rich country with a corrupt and failed ruling class that has endured its resources and has left millions of its people in poverty .
Finally , Mr Mölzer , my advice , be not such a pessimist .
I therefore call on the Council to present to Parliament its position on the new Parliament &apos;s proposal , so that the ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010 and to ensure that social and environmental requirements are respected , on the basis of reciprocity , by producers and non-ACP exporters .
This means that the Commission , as coordinator of the Energy Community , should call on Ukraine to order and remind it of its obligations in terms of energy supply for Europe .
in writing . - We naturally regret all victims of aggressive and authoritarian regimes , regardless of the crimes committed in Europe or in former European colonies , for example .
The main objective of the regulation must be to implement a new common culture of control and accountability , instead of imposing a bureaucratic and costly test process for each product .
Member of the Commission . - The EU &apos;s current competition policy for vertical agreements is very favourable to sales online , and I am sure you will be aware of this , Mr President .
On the other hand , however , the report contains clear recommendations about the second and third error , which goes in the right direction .
As far as transport is concerned , much more needs to be done to introduce restrictions on car manufacturers so that they can design more energy-efficient solutions .
The financial situation in some of the countries of the euro area , which has been the subject of today , clearly shows the dangers of moving away from the agreements of the Stability and Growth Pact .
I therefore think it very sensible to consider how we can make the most of the savings in order to broaden the European Energy Programme for Recovery in order to take account of a new and , it seems necessary , separate financial instrument to support energy efficiency and initiatives in the field of renewable energy .
The Commission , and we in Parliament , have chosen not to raise the issue of the management of funds deliberately at all , because we have taken on the assumption that the sector will live up to its own promises of dealing with this matter without legislative pressure .
This leads me to two questions relating to the Europe 2020 strategy .
( EL ) Madam President , as far as the manufacturing industry is concerned , I should like to remind the House that Pakistan is the world &apos;s fourth largest cotton producers , with its share of global production of 9 % , and the European Union is taking a place with less than 5.5 % .
The Council and , above all , this Parliament are also taking part in the decision on the composition of the College and on the documents that you will make available , as well as in the programme for the next five years that you will present .
However , we must understand that it is only a year since the start of the action was taken and that we need to speed up the work in this area in 2009 .
Of course , this is reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people , because the country has already come into recession and the living conditions of workers and people are getting worse , inequalities are increasing and the number of people suffering from poverty is growing .
These objectives , President of the Commission and President of the Council , have already been set out in the 2020 targets .
We are already cooperating with many Arab countries on initiatives for Turkey to acquire gas to hopefully Nabucco .
Therefore , action to combat it entirely is the objective of health policy , to which national governments can best contribute by making the measure as flexible as possible .
As this is my last speech in this House , I thank all my fellow Members and staff for their cooperation .
I am aware of the fact that there are significant differences between the various Member States &apos; electoral systems at the moment .
Many doctors are beginning the first contact with the treatment of drugs against dementia too late not to exceed their budget , which is counterproductive .
Paradoxically , this instrument can easily , in practice , be misused not only by extremists but also by very strong , powerful lobbies of interest , because we believe that the threshold for one million voices is not a big threshold , taking into account the Union &apos;s demographic capacity .
This systematic approach was established in the 2010 budget .
According to the report by the UN working group , the victims of trafficking are people with different social origins , including people with good synthesis and the poorest , well educated and uncomfortable women , very young and old age .
President-in-Office of the Council . - This is indeed a very important question .
We need more and improved European economic governance so that national action supports these objectives , including a tax on financial transactions , and I encourage the Commission to look carefully at this taxpayer , including in the European context .
I believe that it is extremely important to recognise the prescriptions between Member States , because this is not just about healthcare , but also about operating care , but we have a bit of time to work on the details .
First of all , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports , which deal with important issues relating to the European Union &apos;s contribution to the European Union &apos;s trade policy : respect for human rights , striving for economic prosperity and social justice , achieving sustainable growth and respect for the environment , and especially for the climate system .
When a product is bought , consumers will be able to benefit from a number of recovery measures and will be entitled to claim compensation in the absence of these funds .
Mr President , the reason for the urgent procedure is the brutal assassination of 50 seven people who were accompanied by a politician who was going to register as a candidate for elections for province .
A new intelligent , symmetric system will result in stricter supervision , more in-depth assessments by the Commission , the European Parliament , the Council and the European Central Bank and in the formulation of recommendations for additional reforms and correction plans .
The Syrian people deserve long-awaited political reforms , particularly in the areas of freedom of expression , assembly , participation in political life and governance .
Many of these children are British citizens who have fallen victim to trade in the UK themselves and did not come from external sources , if I may say so .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the third quarter of 2009 , the European Union has returned to the path of growth , which might lead us to say that the worst behind us .
In this context , it is expected that Greece will adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reforms aimed at making the public administration more effective , at accelerating the reform of the healthcare system and the pension system , at improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of its negotiating systems , at improving the functioning of the product market and improving the business environment and maintaining stability in the banking and financial sector .
We believe that it is still important for the agreements between sovereign states to bear in mind the following issues : respect for the sovereignty of the country and its people , mutual interest , reciprocity and cooperation , taking into account each country &apos;s specific characteristics ; evaluating what everyone can bring to the agreement from an economic , social and cultural point of view .
I believe that the transition to a sustainable , green economy will even proceed without imposing excessive legislative measures .
It seems that everyone has forgotten the contribution of the United States and , of course , NATO to peace in Europe .
I think we should see this as the right opportunity to give Europe what it is calling for : economic growth , jobs , a dynamic sector for small businesses , more innovation , more efficient public procurement - on this basis , the citizens will judge .
I believe that it is not up to us to anticipate possible developments in these countries .
The second draft concerns concessions .
Madam President , during the course of the European elections in 2004 , Ireland banned smoking in the workplace and , as a result , it was full of dirty voters from outside .
At a time of severe constraints in state activity , the growing budget in the EU is a sign of trust in the joint project and of strengthening the actions taken at supranational level .
I know that we will be able to send out good messages , so let us spread .
This report contains guidelines for analysing air agreements , both in terms of content and in terms of procedures to be adopted .
The language law introduces the state of imbalances .
Perhaps , since the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force on 1 December , British domestic politics can also be left behind the doors of this House .
The European Parliament is creating turmoil in tar sands and the reality is very different .
We also support the need for every national parliament to be fully involved , in accordance with its budgetary and control powers , in order to increase transparency , accountability and integrity in the decisions taken , including at European level .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , there are five plus two questions on economic governance and the Europe 2020 strategy .
That is why I believe that we should involve the national authorities , the European Commission and also the Members of the European Parliament actively in promoting SOLVIT .
Promoting an agro-industrial model , along with protecting the interests of large agricultural undertakings , has led to the qualitative impoverishment of the world &apos;s agricultural industry over the years , agricultural investment has been insufficient , supported by those abandoned by the agricultural industry and the elimination of small and medium-sized farms , thereby weakening a sector that has allowed 70 % of the world &apos;s poor people to live in life .
The economic aspect : the amount paid to producers is lower than their production costs , and the CAP must make it possible to solve this problem .
Once again , I urge the Commission , in its contacts with the Congolese Government , to keep up its pressure for the law to be passed in Congo .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I can well understand that this Parliament is very interested in the action taken within and outside the Union to solve the problems of public finances in some Member States .
We stand with the will of the peoples who want a better life , an issue and a better tomorrow .
You even have the support of the Irish members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
This new dimension of European foreign policy is a direction in which we should , in fact , move towards greater freedom , justice and social rights in the future .
It was my office that drew up a working document on sanctions imposed on Syria ; in this case , we have a leading role .
On a day when we can overcome the poverty of communism , the day will disappear .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the review of the revision of the competition rules with regard to horizontal cooperation - B7-0565 / 2010 ) .
That is what you have fought for together , bluetongue and the orange .
I believe that this procedure , like increasing food safety in the EU , creates greater transparency for Member States and third countries that export meat products to the EU .
In the light of this , the agreement with Mercosur appears to be risky , especially as the Swedish Food and Biotechnology Institute stated that the coal footprint present in Brazilian waters cannot be 35 times higher than the current one in the Irish waters .
Article 4a and 4b ) of the regulation adds a sentence as &apos; The same reference rate applies to the annual revision of the charges referred to in Articles 4a and 4b and Article 2 of the Treaty .
Today , the Irish Government has asked and met Europe for a gesture of solidarity .
Let us look at Ireland , for example , a country that has been hit particularly hard by the financial crisis : its membership of the monetary union has shelled it from an even greater crisis .
President Klaus is concerned about the claims made by the Germans on property in Sudan and , after listening to the speeches by the German Members on this subject , there is an absolute need , in my opinion , for concern .
an increase in aid from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund , as well as greater financial support for technical measures related to the creation and implementation of projects ;
Without the introduction of a element in which countries know that they will have severe consequences if they pursue unreasonable economic policy , we will have nothing to do .
We must strengthen and support further efforts to combat climate change .
( Applause from the left )
As always with such complicated cases , I have received huge support from my shadow team , Bernadette Vergnaud , Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle .
In Russia , freedom of the press and of the media is a truly serious problem .
Similarly , it is up to the Member States to decide on the ratification of the framework convention for the protection of national minorities or on the signing of a European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages , two of the most important instruments introduced by the Council of Europe .
It is therefore a structured dialogue that gives us the opportunity to exchange our views on matters of concern .
Thirdly , I am thinking about the whole area of sustainable development , where people with work will be protected and supported by safeguards against job losses and the need to move through the entire subsidy cycle and raise skills over the next year or two in order to achieve new jobs ; it is about maintaining current jobs .
Madam President , our questions have been formulated with a view to highlighting the benefits that our citizens can expect from the package of such measures and what we can offer in such a package .
I voted in favour of the report because it also makes some significant improvements to the text of the European Commission , particularly in the section on the protection of citizens &apos; data .
Furthermore , we have reviewed the unused 2009 funds and managed to find a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II .
We thank you very much for your proposal and for a clear signal .
I can also see the elements and the attempt to adopt a holistic approach that has not proved to be fully successful , but is a step in the right direction .
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission , which has sometimes shown some dismay , and the Council , where we tried to find sensible solutions at night &apos;s meetings , because only an hour ago the Council also approved the reasonable compromise that we reached .
In order to guarantee extensive and coordinated action , the Commission , together with the European Organisation for the Safety of Shipping Aviation ( Euroconsecutive ) , has established a European secondary Settlement Coordination for Disagement ( Euroconfiscation ) .
At the same time , it should be remembered that rarely on this problem - in this case , illegal logging - is creating conditions for the trade in illegally harvested timber .
I come from Portugal , from the Azores region , where the dairy market is of great importance and is rooted in socially more sensitive regions where it would actually be necessary to maintain the quota system after 2015 .
People are not the product of distinct cultures ; separate cultures are the product of distinct peoples .
In some cases , they are good enough for them to be taken into account .
( SV ) Mr President , Iceland is a small country in terms of the population , as it has some 300 000 inhabitants , but a great nation .
Mr President , MEPs have an important role to play in the supervision of health claims .
That is why we say &apos; yes &apos; to Nabucco , but equally forceful is our support for our governments &apos; efforts to ensure that the diversification of supply will bring prosperity to the citizens of our countries .
Political parties , the legal system is corrupt , human rights are violated there , and freedom of expression and freedom of association do not have a form like that in the United Kingdom or in most European countries .
We need an energy mix for obvious reasons , with different energy sources based on the broadest possible basis , because only this will stabilise the energy situation and , as a result , the diversity of every nation , as well as the European Union , will find due recognition .
I doubt , however , that when Parliament refers to international law , condemning certain shameful practices when the legal basis for this is very vague .
By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia , I clearly express my full support for the Tunisian people and their historic democratic revolution .
Furthermore , it calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies , such as national action plans or targeted social measures , with a view to reducing energy poverty and tabling regular reports on the resolution of this problem .
If you force the law through the Hungarian Parliament , thinking that it can now be changed only by a two-thirds majority , you know that it will not be easy to change after the next elections .
Generalised system of tariff preferences ( debate )
During today &apos;s plenary sitting , we voted on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
The question of a new feeling of mutual trust gives us another huge problem .
This year , we have allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS , but the actual costs will be assessed after the first year of action by the service when Parliament will report on all spending relating to the work of the EEAS .
My question concerns Pakistan and , as we all know , the chronic instability in Pakistan is at the root of the crisis throughout the region , including Afghanistan .
Obviously , with regard to men and women , we must not forget the natural differences in biological diversity .
We cannot ignore those factors when talking about the idea of using the revenues from infrastructure charges .
( HU ) Mr President , in this directive , I welcome the clearer definition of patients &apos; rights , the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed solution to the problem of a lack of skilled staff in their own country .
Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , I would like to make a few remarks directly to the questions and questions that have been raised .
Last week in committee , I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a spectrum Presidency .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the constant violation of human rights in the country , particularly with regard to freedom of association , freedom of expression and the right to information , and because I support the dreams of the Iranian people about democracy .
It is particularly important that funding is mobilised quickly .
The creation of such a mechanism is one thing and making it accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens so that they can make full use of it , another .
Not only will the Agreement make the Canadian and European markets more competitive - it will also make them safer , since there will be a rapprochement of regulatory and executive bodies to cooperate in all matters relating to certification , inspections and enforcement in order to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and freight flights .
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant .
Furthermore , the private nature of tourism not only promotes Europe &apos;s image in the world , but also promotes European citizenship .
Mr President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are discussing in this sitting is aimed at revising the regulations adopted in 2004 , which improve and harmonised safety rules on protection against the unfair use of passports and travel documents by various EU citizens , while also introducing biometric identifiers .
Secondly , there is a need to create a kind of temporary institutional framework for the mechanism for implementing decisions .
That being said , I would like to point out a positive aspect , because some of the recent agreements are very good , such as a free trade agreement with Korea .
It is therefore important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade is aware that his current approach of constructive cooperation with the European Union is much more effective than the constant attempts to regulate history .
This may seem ridiculous , but until now , the European Commission has not found sufficient arguments or time to persuade the Latvian Government to put an end to this linguistic discrimination .
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to take care to help the Pakistani Government end the disastrous discrimination against religious minorities living in the country .
It will be an effective tool for preventing illegal migration , organised crime and trafficking in human beings .
This is admissible and legitimate , and we have fought for it .
It is , of course , more necessary than ever for financial institutions to reconsider and reassess their attitude .
Our common objective is to minimise catches and discards , and that is what we have achieved in committee .
The main objective of aid for trade is to increase national and international competitiveness in the 48 countries .
Even by adopting as an important starting point a rational basis for internalising external costs , the old &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle is ultimately untenable .
I am encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in our debate in this plenary .
Furthermore , we have some concerns when we look at the starting point .
The primary objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States - whether they are indifferent or centre right or centre left - is to protect the continued profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the workers &apos; class in the European Union .
It is therefore necessary to promote the dissemination of good practices and raise awareness among local authorities about the potential for use of ICT .
Mr President , it was not possible to hear an English translation of the previous speech .
However , there is a very important aspect of this recast , namely the codification , which concerns all the restructuring of the TEN-T in the next decade .
( LT ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s joint resolution on Ukraine plays a key role for the people of that country , but let us not forget that it is also very important for the people of the European Union , because Ukraine is a significant partner for us , particularly as regards the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in Eastern Europe .
That is why the Commission should have its voice heard .
We cannot deal with an issue where the US Government has exclusive competence .
The people who manage our forests receive little or no payment for doing these invisible tasks , which many people consider to be a asset .
Unfortunately , it must also be said that the list of unresolved problems is not becoming shorter .
Following on from Mr Salafranca &apos;s valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America , I would ask the Council and the Commission , now represented by Baroness Ashton , to take urgent action on three issues .
There are spiritually dealers , with strong market positions in some Member States , as well as in many minor dealers , for whom our current proposal is better than that which has been in force since 2002 , because they have said that certain aspects , which are completely unintended by the legislator in 2002 , are not in their interests , but rather are more difficult for them to compete by large dealers .
It must establish &apos; the EU &apos;s regional political partnership for peace and development in the Horn of Africa &apos; , which was started by the Committee on Development , which adopted its report in April 2007 .
In those years , especially following the historic expansion of 2004 , the context and ambition of the common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) have undergone far-reaching changes .
Spain is taking over the baton of the Presidency of the European Union as soon as the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force .
In this context , it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme complies with the objectives already set out in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and that it falls within the priority actions of the Single Market Act .
I would like to give my strong support to Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposal .
As a result of the recommendation by the Committee on Legal Affairs , the Commission &apos;s proposal has been amended in accordance with the report that has now been put to the vote .
It is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading .
These people are in the greatest need and they should not be excluded because of where they live .
All medical assistance , regardless of its distinctive characteristics , is within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union .
However , I would like to warn the House once again that the recent analyses of the European Criminal District have shown once again that this methodology has serious restrictions because of the low participation of women in such theories .
The aim is not to use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , but , on the other hand , they should not prevent us from achieving these social and environmental targets either .
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the recovery of organic waste , especially in this area dominated by agriculture , on reviewing data and on developing a system for exchanging best practices .
A right which stipulates that orthodoxy priests , biskupi and patriarchies must be Turkish citizens is completely incomprehensible .
The most significant issue in the position adopted by Parliament is the comment that it draws attention to the displacement of activities that can therefore lack cohesion , not only as a corps of legislation , but especially when it comes to their implementation .
( RO ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured that the European Union accedes to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
At least in the case of the single digital Single Market , which has become one of the EU &apos;s priorities .
This would be a significant step forward in the direction of transparency , openness and clarity of the European process .
( DE ) Mr President , I support the proposal of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) because , of course , it makes sense to debate it .
Is this the model of economic development that Europe should propose to its people ?
In essence , I do not allow the speakers to exceed their speaking time , but I think we all agree that the words of Mrs Tzaveli are particularly important to us .
We want the right strategy based on new technologies , innovation and investment - a strategy that will ultimately improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region .
This is indeed a great achievement because , while not considering the legal basis , this directive recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and opens them with new opportunities for access to better treatment .
Year after year , the Court of Auditors is unable to give us this satisfaction that the EU budget is being spent in a legally and normally , and I was really concerned about the lack of control over taxpayers &apos; money when , in 2002 , I was the main accountant of the European Commission .
For me , this is both a huge challenge and a great honour .
If we are to be honest , we must recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and the fact that our per capita emissions are still greater than in China or India , for example .
I am sure that the dialogue will be constructive as a result of these comments .
We therefore regret that , as in the case of Europol , haste has taken precedence over the desire to safeguard fundamental freedoms .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal to introduce an additional , faster method of using the European Social Fund &apos;s reserves in order to enable a quicker and more effective response to the economic and social difficulties facing Europe .
In fact , I should vote against the proposed composition of the Commission , but among the weak candidates there were also some very good candidates , including the Polish candidate Janusz Lewandowski .
President of the Commission . - You are very kind , Mr Kirkhope , but , in fact , as well as the United Kingdom , you are 26 other Member States in the European Union , so please understand that , while we are very open to your concerns , I must also listen to other legitimate voices .
We must ensure that the EU &apos;s humanitarian response is impartial , even if it is difficult in crisis areas .
In addition to what has already been said in Parliament in the past , new points have been added , calling on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of the investigations carried out by all parties , and to present the results of the European Parliament , reminding us that the responsibility and credibility of the European Union and its Member States must be fully monitored , as well as expressing the concerns about the pressure from the Goldstone NGOs involved in this report .
I also hope that this decision will help save the original fish species .
I hope that you will see my questions not as a provocation but as an incentive to think .
I am always ready - and , thankfully , I can say so - to come to Parliament again to present the results we have obtained , but we must be sure about them .
Such a result will strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating position in international trade talks , especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations of the World Trade Organisation .
If Europe speaks with one voice , the United States of America will also adopt the same goal .
For this reason , I also support permanent prices for European tobacco growers , at least for as long as the people of Europe feed .
If we look at the initiatives taken by various Member States , it is clear that some of the Member States take this issue more seriously than others .
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund ( ESF ) that is distinct from European structural policy .
The number of new infections continues to prevail over the development of therapy and , as a result , two thirds of the people who require treatment in 2009 did not get it , meaning that 10 million people did not have the necessary access to effective treatment .
Indeed , where the dignity of the human being is valued , minorities are not seen negatively .
I look forward to the Commission &apos;s proposal to simplify the activities of this fund .
In future , all EU institutions should ensure that our budget can help citizens and businesses move through difficult economic times and plan for economic recovery .
The fastest way to teach these areas , which are much more effective and practical than all top-down , is to support citizens &apos; initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions .
Anyone who is still struggling with this treaty today is in the wrong belief that the Treaty strengthens the European Union , I say : those who are fighting the Treaty are actually strengthening our so-called partners or who , like , is willing , opponents .
The Union &apos;s support for global capitalism gives us all a waste .
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting where the Commission will take action to develop the network of other modes of transport .
You will remember that this was a cut-price struggle that came to the Court of Justice , and the Commission - and I have to commend you - has taken a strong , tougher position than the Council , and we are fully in favour of the Commission .
The first person who asked for the floor this morning was Mr Madlener .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski &apos;s report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
( DE ) Mr President , the position taken by the governments of the most important EU Member States , the European Commission and the European Central Bank is easy to determine .
I would remind the House that , according to recent data in the European Union , there are still more than 20 million unemployed - and this number has already increased to 25 million today - meaning that inviting even more asylum seekers to Europe is actually something of collective suicide .
Sanctions must be imposed on the Commission , not on finance ministers .
The economic recovery of Sri Lanka depends on foreign direct investment and on the EU &apos;s economic support .
We fully support the objective of the vaccination initiative , but we could not support the reference to another vote in this House , which advocates , among other things , abortion and which runs counter to the previous explanations of vote that we tabled for this Parliament &apos;s act .
This document is the result of a compromise following lengthy negotiations , extending the application of passenger rights without imposing an additional burden on carriers .
It is now time to fill the content of the &apos; G &apos; line by establishing a real , effective economic union as the last stage of European integration of economic policy .
I am particularly concerned about the issue of children &apos;s rights in the context of foreign relations .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union has been trying to arm itself with legislative instruments in the field of economic immigration for 10 years now .
The Stihler report is a useful tool for removing administrative and technical barriers preventing the marketing of construction products and allowing the single market to continue to be established in this sector .
I believe that if we really want to follow the objectives that we have set out in the treaties for our foreign policy , there will be a long way to go before we send illegally staying immigrants to Libya in the EU .
That is why I supported the resolution on the European Innovation Partnership , and it seems to me that we should all engage in innovation because , as I said , this is very important for the future .
We have a newly elected government in the UK that has made promises in this respect .
The next item is the report by Mr Alves , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation of the EC No 247 / 2006 on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the European Union - C7-0255 / 2009 - .
The economic crisis and environmental policy can coexist and bring us positive results in terms of both environmental protection and job creation .
There are countries that do not use all the funds allocated to them from the European Social Fund and leave approximately 30-40 % .
That is exactly what I am wondering - even if the Commission is claiming that it has information and publishing it and that its publication is obligatory - why this situation was not known , for example .
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I strongly support the proposal for effective information campaigns in order to disseminate points of single contact .
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and wants us to make the goals of economic policy mandatory .
I voted today in favour of enhanced cooperation on unitary patent protection because I do not find justifications for the language impasse that has been created in the Council .
I repeat : the Treaty clearly states that a Member State cannot be forced into debt .
I would remind you that the European Parliament and the Council have agreed together that 2010 will be the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
I would like to assure this House that we will continue to raise these issues , including at the highest level , and remind the People &apos;s Republic of China of international commitments in the field of human rights .
I hope - and I am sure - that your votes will lay the foundations for an agreement .
Firstly , I regret the fact that Commissioner McCreevy is not here - another season of horses has probably just begun !
You may not be aware of this , but in order to verify the claim of this kind , for example , we need extensive animal testing .
Commissioner , the issue that I refer to with some suspicion is the significant impact that the Cariforum 21 group has had on the process that has started here .
We do not agree .
EU aid planned for the 2007-2010 period , aimed at promoting democracy and good governance in Moldova amounts to more than EUR 50 million .
Of course , we cannot understand how the illegal worker is doing his job , and the person who takes it to cover the cost of his stay and sustain is ultimately punished .
I believe that this type of measuring system , which is based on confirming the different parameters , will lead to political decisions that are more suited to the needs of society and the economy in general .
At the same time , I would like to point out that dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional and directly linked to the lifting of restrictions and the end of repression against peaceful demonstrators and human rights activists .
Finally , High Representative , you are visiting the Middle East .
Worse still , the US Congress has taken reprisals by adopting a law on the protection of members of the US services just one month after the ICC was established in July 2002 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to explain briefly that this report contains amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Development of the Rural Areas following Parliament &apos;s adoption of the resolution of 19 June 2008 , in which Parliament rejected the Commission &apos;s proposal to authorise poultry meat for human consumption even after it was adopted by people .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to express my personal sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deepest concern about the fate of the four other Cuban prisoners and opposition activists who themselves began in protest .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 2010-2014 multiannual programme on the area of freedom , security and justice ( Stockholm Programme ) .
Our motto should be : &apos; Not wasting a penny &apos; .
The Union , especially the Mediterranean countries , has always taken action to provide humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people , given the fundamental importance of solidarity with the people living in such difficult conditions .
Often , workers themselves are isolated and , in this situation , access to trade unions is often greatly hampered .
( Applause from the floor and applause )
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission for their statements today .
However , in its current form , although some of the amendments have made it possible to improve them , the Guillaume report offers a real incentive to abuse the procedure , blocking the right mechanisms and depriving them of access to those things that should really be dealt with quickly .
We must do all we can to achieve this today , and I would like to thank the authors , Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer , for their excellent work , which serves us all .
We have done a truly huge amount of work by voting on important , significant reports .
The so-called social dumping poses a serious threat to workers , because it fundamentally undermines their rights .
The Commission and the Council must redouble their efforts to ensure respect for human rights in the Republic of Congo .
( EL ) Madam President , with regard to what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of each proposed proposal , I should like to ask whether it is possible to carry out an ex ante study on the geographical area in the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation , bearing in mind the specific features of this area , so that we have criteria that each country would have to take into account from the outset and comply with its planning ?
We also need to look at the issue of Roma women , who are particularly affected by poverty , access to housing , discrimination and violence , and the problems of the young Roma , who lack qualifications even more makes it difficult to access employment during this difficult economic crisis .
in writing . - ( PT ) I am pleased to vote in favour of the amendment concerning the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) to broaden the scope of its interventions within the housing sector so that it can help marginalised communities in all Member States .
It is also a reminder for all those who are responsible for shaping policy directions in the areas within their remit that , in order to guarantee real freedom of the press , the public authorities should play their part : they should be ready to safeguard freedom of expression and promote the development of this freedom .
Mr President , I think the European Union has become far too large , too multicultural , and I simply do not trust this system completely and will get worse .
It is too soon to announce the results of this analysis and every stage of this process , as the honourable Member knows very well , requires unanimity from the Council .
It should be noted that the prospect of EU integration with the EU is a strong incentive for the Balkan countries to undertake the necessary reforms , as well as a factor in regional stability .
Now that advertising has an increasingly important role , we need to lay down criteria to enable consumers and patients to be fully aware and certain about the effects of using these medicines .
To say Neil Armstrong , this would be a small step for European funds , but it would be a huge step for the European economy .
Thirdly , the security gaps that some of you have said will arise if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement simply do not exist .
