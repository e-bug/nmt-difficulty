We have developed a common European standard on minority rights, and this is an absolute requirement.

MEPs have said'no' to the'no' to the'flexible response and' no'to the unacceptable pressure being exerted by France on the largest democratic body of the continent of Europe!
author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the international community, we are undoubtedly putting a lot of our credibility at risk with the events in Afghanistan.
However, our arguments must be found for substance so that people do not feel that the European Union only cares about themselves, and should also see that it is concerned about the interests of its peoples.
It explains why we still have these timid requests from Members calling on Member States to accept the innocent prisoners who cannot return to their own countries out of fear of torture.

The challenges were huge: there should be a transition from the Treaty of Nice to what is stipulated by the Treaty of Lisbon; moreover, the next multiannual programme would be prepared, setting out the priorities to be given to the area of freedom, security and justice for the next five years.
I think we have here a currency that is, in fact, solid and solid in history.
It is central to all that we do in the country to ensure that there is real legal order in practice and that the rule of law is, of course, applied within the legal system, but also within the framework of such a necessary political and constitutional reform.
It is in this context that problems must be addressed in connection with the operational needs of the European Parliament and the European Union and the harmonisation of their expenditure.

Given the serious impact of bluetongue on livestock farming, any measure facilitating good practice in vaccination should be adopted so that farmers are protected from the loss of animals, causing damage that is often fatal to them.

President-in-Office of the Council. - In December 2008, the Poznańska conference agreed on a 2009 work programme on clear measures for the Copenhagen climate change conference, to be held in December 2009.

in writing. - (SK) The aim of this proposal is to ensure that consumers in all 27 EU Member States can rely on a high level of consumer protection and that businesses of all sizes can provide goods and services to consumers in all 27 EU Member States without unnecessary legal obstacles.

This fund has not been mobilised in my country, Estonia, and when I asked why it was so, I learnt that the conditions are very stringent and that the limit that has been applied to 1 000 people to date meant that it was impossible.
I am convinced that together, we will be able to agree on the fundamental principles that should guide and facilitate future EU-US cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
Mr President, it is very worrying to see how the number of brutal and violent attacks on Christians and their assemblies is increasing.
Other proposals are aimed at improving the Stability and Growth Pact, which is to examine particularly carefully at the level of debt, as well as at economic governance of the euro area, and a stable and credible mechanism for preventing and eliminating excessive debt in the euro area.
Another problem is the service charge in relation to outsourcing.
We do not want companies to look for in different countries for the best conditions and the creation in the European Union of a new'Delaware', where companies can circumvent this type of legislation.

We need to evaluate and get a full understanding of what we have, what the effects are, what may be taken and what overlap, in order to be able to propose new measures and more prudent measures.
I see it as a joint responsibility and therefore it would be a good thing if everyone could contribute to tackling the crisis.
However, we have talked about this holistic approach in the past.
This 13th session is the most important one in 2010, and it will involve high-level meetings and discussions with government ministers on a number of important issues which the Commissioner and the Minister have already mentioned, such as the impact of the global financial crisis on the human rights situation throughout the world.
I also believe that the number of errors and miscarriages of justice is relatively small - but still too much.

That is not my words.

Action taken on Parliament's resolutions: see Minutes

I think we can expect a whole range of initiatives that require the Commission to do more, that the Commission wants more Europe, and that the Commission will undoubtedly respond with enthusiasm.

We will see how they are applied in the future.
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament's efforts more seriously in this respect and I find it a pity and regret that the representative of the Council is no longer in place.

Nevertheless, as a form of primary prevention, I call for measures to be implemented to stimulate a healthy lifestyle as a necessary factor in improving health.

Take up the fight and fight for democracy once again.

The main producer countries, with the support of the majority of Members who are sensitive to industry's argument, have managed to prevent us from setting an ambitious emission reduction target.

All these are examples of the benefits of research in animals.
Documents received: see Minutes
Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, because this initiative has a huge symbolic value exceeding the EUR 146 million that has been agreed and the impact of which we hope will be excessive.
I believe that Europe's cultural life is of great importance in bringing Europeans closer together in a way that respects the various cultural and linguistic differences in full.
I think it is very important to promote not only competitiveness in the agricultural sector, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, ecological farming and local distribution.
Specific exceptions are also allowed for remote rural areas and islands, such as Orkney and Shetland in my constituency, where longer journey times are inevitable.
The policies applied address our citizens and disappoint them and the decision-making procedures do not encourage them to participate, as the European elections have recently shown.
You are right when it comes to the delay; there is a certain delay.
The resolution calls on the Commission to respond promptly to the legitimate concerns expressed by the petitioner, who has been in this unacceptable situation for 13 years, and thus has been suffering considerable loss of income and to do what is needed to enable the petitioner to assert his rights.

I am very clear to all the leaders I am talking to what I think needs to happen, and I do this with the support of Parliament and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council with representatives from the 27 Member States.

Nuclear energy is simply established in a way that each country has a nuclear safety regulator, with full responsibility for the implementation of nuclear safety measures.
However, the interesting thing is that it is true that a number of countries are having problems as a result of the financial crisis, but it is also true - and I believe that Mr Lamberts will recognise and appreciate what I say - that in most of the countries that have a fixed view of public finances, the governments are not socialist.
Various scenarios are possible and different from the peaceful transfer of power to economic chaos by pro-democratic forces and the breaking out of an armed conflict, and the use of nuclear weapons cannot even be ruled out.
In our ageing society, more and more will suffer neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or sentiment.
With regard to the issue of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the changes to the European Social Fund, I would like to thank you for your excellent cooperation, as dialogue has been so constructive that, in this meeting, we have targets within reach and I think that this is extremely important.
What do you think about also stimulating the Member States themselves to take the measures they have applied for under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as soon as they submitted an application, because it would at least ensure that workers would not have to wait for this application to be granted?
These strategies and programmes cannot exist only on paper because they would only highlight the inconsistency and lack of confidence in the laws adopted by the EU itself.

As we opened up our markets when we joined the European Union, we are paying the same amounts for the budget and many other things.

In addition, human trafficking is still a serious problem in the European Union.
I would also like to emphasise a couple of points, in response to Mr Paparizov.

(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the Kirilov report will take place in the coming weeks, and I welcome it because it is urgent.

There needs to be a study into the total accounts.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a general remark and then I would like to ask two or three questions depending on how much time I have.

We are holding the debate far too technocratic.
I therefore congratulate Mr Millán Mon on this brilliant report, which comes at a good time to strengthen relations between the two continents.
That is why we have created a considerable simplification of EU law.
Unfortunately, important amendments were rejected by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left and, consequently, no initiative can be signed by persons living in the European Union but are not citizens of a particular Member State, thereby excluding equal participation of persons living in Europe, regardless of nationality, and there is also no guarantee that signatures will be compatible with the signatories.
I call for the creation of an independent feature of Kenyan and international legal experts to carry out investigations and prosecutions of the violent events that took place following the flawed elections in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West is also largely dependent on the results in Afghanistan.
All this has gone too far and must be stopped.
The development of a multi-level guide for public and private actors and the establishment of an education and mobility plan for the practical use of policy resources at several levels could be effective measures to improve regional policy.

The rapporteur particularly regrets that citizens are unaware of the rights that this would give them.
The creation of an area of security, justice and freedom in the European Union is fundamental to all of us, and certainly an example of the European democratic model that we are built up, and many of us believe that Europol is an instrument that can be adapted, and yet it is very important for all of us that the pooling of resources, especially human resources, but also technical resources for combating organised crime and all forms of illegal trade, are strictly controlled and strictly under the control of the Union's rights, and strictly controlled.
It is therefore crucial to take all sorts of measures that contribute to the implementation of impact assessments in an independent and transparent way, thus helping the instrument to maximum help in the decision-making process and truly act as a guarantee of quality and suitability of the activities of European institutions.
Secondly, the strategy should strengthen the internal cohesion of the European Union, in other words, its convergence.
I would also like to add that this is not the direction that the Commission was targeting, because the Commission proposal concentrated - the regulation adopted by Parliament - on the reform of the current credit rating agencies system, which is private, and on the very strict consolidation of indulgencies in order to avoid conflicts of interest, lack of honesty, in their credit-rating work.
It also calls on the Commission to assess what the creation of a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation would cost and what advantages it would bring.

This framework decision should not result in unnecessary red tape in cases where there are better solutions to the problem.
The Bank could not foresee that a major crisis was on the way, nor was it directly excellent in terms of regulation, which is far from perfect.

Report: Patrão Neves
I will turn to two unresolved issues that were raised several times during the debate.

While the protection of the environment and public health safety goes hand in hand, I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers.
This is a difficult problem that we need to resolve together.
We need to cooperate with important consumer countries such as the United States, China, Russia and Japan to tackle this problem and to establish global alert systems and records of illegal logging and trouble countries using Interpol and applicable UN bodies using the latest satellite systems.
Of course, we cannot allow short-term support for industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness.
Let me say that this is a report based on the principle of subsidiarity.

That is why, and we are going to debate this again at first reading, we believe that the first expenditure reflects our priority in this regard, and we, like the rapporteur, believe that emphasis should be placed on multilingualism and buildings, issues which we have always prioritised, but on the legislative aspect of them.

With regard to trade in particular, I would like to ask the Commissioner to confirm that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will not be used to obstruct the sales of medicines sold at more competitive prices, which are undangerous generic medicines which do not violate copyright and whose only memory is that they are manufactured in emerging countries such as India and Brazil and may compete with the world industry.
After all, Members have the right to express their opinion.
That is unacceptable.
We want to be involved in this.

This is also an area where we can take stronger policies to protect competition and consumers.
It is also a shame that these politicians are demanding that we accept the outcome of the second referendum when they themselves did not accept the result of the first one.

This means that the Commission, as coordinator of the Energy Community, should seriously talk to Ukraine and remind the country of its obligations in terms of European security of supply.
in writing. - We of course mourn the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes, not only of the atrocities committed in Europe or of the former European colonies, for example.

With regard to transport, much more needs to be done to tighten up the rules so that those producing vehicles produce more fuel-efficient vehicles.
The financial situation in certain countries of the euro area, which have been dealt with today, clearly demonstrates the danger of removing themselves from the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.

We need more and better European economic governance to support this line, including the financial transaction tax, which I call on the Commission to examine in great detail, including in the European context.
The mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important because it is not only a matter of treatment, but also of hindsight, but we have time to finalise this detail.
First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for the reports, which address important issues relating to what the EU's trade policy can contribute to in achieving some of the fundamental objectives of public policy: respect for human rights and achievement of economic prosperity, social justice, sustainable growth and respect for the environment, in particular, respect for the climate system.
Consumers have access to a number of measures that they can take if they are buying them are not agreed and they are given the right to claim compensation if no measures are taken.

Earth law creates an imbalance.

In addition, we agree that all national parliaments must be fully involved in accordance with their budgetary and control rights so that we can increase transparency, ownership and accountability for the decisions taken, including at EU level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, five plus two questions have been asked on economic governance and Europe 2020.
That is why I believe that we should actively engage the national authorities, the European Commission and MEPs in promoting SOLVIT.
A system based on actual policies and real guidelines, and now Louis Michel, on protagonists and liberal rhetoric that has led to the current situation, promoting the agricultural model of protecting the interests of the large agricultural and food industry, resulting in the deterioration in the quality of the world agricultural industry for years, and in the maintenance of adequate investment in agriculture, and the destruction of large numbers of 70% of large agricultural industries.

This new dimension of EU foreign policy is something we should, and indeed must, follow up in order to make the world more free, fairer and more social secure in the future.
It was my entity that produced the unofficial document on sanctions against Syria; we are the ones in the driver's seat.
The day that we are successfully freeing ourselves from poverty, the winners of Communism will disappear too well.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the revision of the competition rules for horizontal cooperation by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - B7-0565/2010).
That is what you have fought for together, whether the colour is modest or orange.
I believe that this procedure, as well as the strengthening of the EU's general food security, means greater clarity for the Member States and third countries exporting meat products to the EU.
In view of this, it seems strenuous to move forward with a Mercosur agreement, especially as the Institute for Food and Biotechnology, in Sweden, observed that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef could be 35 times higher than that of Irish beef.
In agreement with the Council, a text should be added at the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, which is Article 1 (2) (b) of the amending regulation, which states that the same exchange rate should be applied annually to revise the size of the charges regulated by Articles 4, (b) and 6.3) stating that these charges are expressed in other currencies other than EUR 4 (b).
Today, the Irish Government has requested and rightly received European solidarity.
Just look at Ireland, a country that was particularly hard hit by the financial crisis: membership of the monetary union protected the country from an even greater crisis.
He fears German demand for Sudeten property and, having heard German politicians talk about this subject, I think his fear is entirely justified.
Greater support from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, as well as increased financial support for technical activities related to the preparation and implementation of projects.
We will only get there without a mechanism that makes countries realise that it would fail to conduct an economic policy without rice and resonance.
We need to improve and promote further efforts to tackle climate change.
(Applause to the left)
As always with these complex issues, I have had excellent cooperation with my own group of shadow rapporteurs - Mrs Vergnaud, Mr Buşoi and Mrs Rühle.
In Russia, freedom of the press and of the media is a huge problem.
Similarly, it is up to each Member State to decide whether to sign or ratify the framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are the two main instruments established by the Council of Europe.
It is therefore a structured dialogue that enables us to change our views on issues that are close to our hearts.
Thirdly, it concerns the whole area of sustainability, where people who have work already receive protection and a certain amount of support to ensure that they do not lose their jobs, and when one or two years later, they need to be retrained or upheld in order to have another job.
Our questions have all been intending to bring about the benefits our citizens can expect and what we can offer in such a package of measures.
I voted in favour of this report because it also adds some significant improvements to the European Commission text, particularly with regard to the protection of individuals as regards personal data processing.
In addition, we have undertaken a review of unused funds from 2009 so that a total of EUR 1.9 billion can be allocated for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for the Internet via broadband in category II.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for a very clear message.
There are elements of this and also an attempt to take a holistic approach, which has failed to succeed in the way we imagine but which are still in the right direction.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which was sometimes a little slower on the pretext, and the Council, where we tried to find reasonable solutions in the evening sessions and in many trialogues, because only an hour ago, they also agreed to the sensible compromise proposal that we drafted.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, set up a crisis coordination cell for European aviation after the Transport Ministers' meeting on 4 May 2010.
At the same time, it is important to remember that rarely the disease itself, in this case, illegal logging, which creates the conditions for the trade in illegal timber.
I come from the country of Portugal and the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and established in regions that are socially quite fragile and where it would, in fact, be important to maintain the quota system longer than 2015.
It is not the people who are the product of different cultures; different cultures are different from different peoples.
In some cases, they are actually so good that they should be taken into account.
Mr President, Iceland is a small nation in population, 300 000 inhabitants, and it is a Greek nation!
Mr President, MEPs have an important role to play by examining health claims decisions.
Therefore, we definitely say'yes' to Nabucco, but equally definitely our decision is to support the efforts of our governments to ensure the diversification of supplies contributes to the well-being of our citizens.
Political parties can be banned, there is corruption in the justice system, there are violations of human rights, and freedom of expression and association does not exist in the same way as in countries such as the United Kingdom or most other European states.
It is also obvious that we need an energy mix consisting of various energy sources that is as broad-based as possible, because it helps stabilise energy efficiency and, therefore, each country's diversity will lead to independence - as it is for Europe.
However, Parliament's invitation to international law in condemning certain appalling phenomena, when the legal basis for this condemnation is far from clear, raises doubts.
By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I clearly express my full support for the Tunisian people and for the historic democratic revolution they have started.
In addition, it calls on Member States to adopt appropriate measures and policies, such as national action plans or targeted social measures, to reduce energy poverty, as well as regularly reporting their work on these issues.
If you force a law through the Hungarian Parliament and invite it, from now on, to change it only by a two-thirds majority, you know that it will not be easy to change it again after the next elections.
Generalised System of Preferences (debate)
Today in this House, we voted on the recommendation for harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
The talk of a new sense of mutual trust faces us another major problem.
This year, we allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS, but it will be possible to estimate the actual costs after the first operational year, when a report on all expenditure related to the work of the EEAS will be presented to the European Parliament.
My question concerns Pakistan: the chronic instability in that country is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis in the region as a whole and also in the crisis in Afghanistan.
However, naturally, we must not forget the natural, biological differences that exist between men and women.
We must also not forget the idea of earmarking revenue from infrastructure charges.
(HU) Mr President, what I welcome with this directive is the clearer definition of patients' rights, the end of endless queues and the proposed solution to the problem of non-availability of experts in their own country.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me make a few comments on the issues that have been raised.
Last week in committee, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being an invisible Presidency.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the continued violation of human rights there, particularly of the freedom of association and freedom of information, and because I support the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran.
In particular, the fast-start financing will be very important.
It is one thing to create such a mechanism, but it also needs to be accessible and comprehensible to European citizens to make full use of it.
This agreement will not only increase the competitiveness of the Canadian and European market, but will also make markets more secure by bringing regulatory authorities and supervisors closer together on all issues relating to certification, inspections and supervision, with a view to ensuring the highest possible level of safety for passenger and goods transport.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can have a thorough debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
In addition, its private dimension reinforces not only the image shown by the European Union to the world, but also promotes European membership.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing today aims to amend regulations approved in 2004, aimed at improving and harmonising security provisions on the protection of European citizens' passports and travel documents against fraudulent use and, at the same time, introducing certain elements of biometric identification.
Secondly, some sort of temporary institutional framework must be created for the implementing mechanism.
However, it is good that some of the agreements that we have recently concluded are very good, such as the Korea Free Trade Agreement.
That is why it is important for Parliament, then, to remind the Commission of the social clause laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also hope very much that Belgrade understands that its current strategy of working constructively with the EU is far more effective than trying to write constantly about history.
Curiously, the European Commission has not yet found sufficient arguments or time to end the Latvian Government from this linguistic discrimination.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to link all sorts of aid to the government of Pakistan with the urgent elimination of this damaging discrimination against its minorities.
In this way, we will also have an effective instrument to stop illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
This is acceptable and legitimate, and we have fought for this.
It is clear that financial institutions more than ever have a need to stop and reconsider their way of working.
Our common objective is to minimise by-catches and discards, and we managed to achieve that objective in committee.
The main objective of the Aid for Tradei initiative is to increase the competitiveness of the 48 states, both within countries and internationally.
Although we accept internalisation of external costs as an appropriate and rational starting point, it is ultimately not only untenable to punish heavy goods vehicles and not ordinary passenger cars if their purpose is to reduce congestion, and the old'polluter pays' principle is clearly applied in a discriminatory manner.
I have been encouraged by understanding and support from this House.
Moreover, when we look at the starting point, we have some concerns.
The main objective of the European Union and the governments of the Member States is, whether they belong to the centre-right or centre left, to ensure the continued profitability of monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes across the European Union.
Action should therefore be taken to disseminate good examples and raise awareness among local decision makers of the benefits of ICT.
Mr President, we could not hear the English interpretation of the previous speech.
However, there is one very important aspect of this recast, this codification, linked to the whole restructuring of the trans-European transport networks in the next decade.
(LT) Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is very important to the people of Ukraine, but let us not forget that it is also very important to the people of Europe, because Ukraine is a major partner of us, particularly in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe.
That is why the Commission must act forcefully.
We cannot intervene on an issue where the US Government alone is competent.
Those managing our forest land are paid a little or nothing to provide these hidden functions, which many take too little.
Unfortunately, it must also be said that the list of unresolved problems is longer than shorter.
As regards Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra's valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, I would ask the Council and the Commission, both now represented by Baroness Ashton, to take urgent action on three points.
We have, on the one hand, large dealers with a strong market presence in a number of Member States and, on the other, a whole series of smaller retailers who feel that our current proposal is better than the 2002 rules, because they have found that some elements, contrary to the 2002 intention of the legislator, have not benefited them, but rather made it more difficult for them to assert themselves in competition from the major traders.
The EU must build up the regional political partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa launched by the Committee on Development when it adopted its report in April 2007.
In these years, and especially after the historic enlargement of 2004, the context and ambitions of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) have changed to a great extent.
Spain is taking over the baton as President of the European Union at the very time of the Treaty of Lisbon coming into force.
In this regard, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda, which are included in the priority actions of the Single Market Act.
I would emphatically like to support Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission's proposal was amended along the lines of the report, which is the subject of the vote, following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is therefore important that we reach a deal at first reading.
These are the people most in need of such efforts and they should not be ruled out because they are in'the wrong place'.
All healthcare, regardless of its specificities, is covered by the Treaty establishing the European Union.
However, I would like to inform the House that this method has serious restrictions because the number of women involved in this attempt is low, as has been reaffirmed in a study recently carried out by the European Society of Cardiology.
It is not intended to achieve social objectives by means of investment agreements, but nor should they hinder us from achieving social and environmental targets.
Greater importance must be given to the recovery of organic waste, especially in this largely fragile area, and I call for control of information and the creation of a system for exchanging best practice.
The law that Orthodox priests, bishops and patriots must be Turkish citizens is completely incomprehensible.
The most important thing about the position adopted by the European Parliament is the attention that it is creating about the proliferation of measures, which, as a result of which, can lack cohesion, not only as a law-collection but especially as regards their introduction.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon means that the European Union must accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.
The issue of a single digital market has at least received a breakthrough among the EU's priorities.
This would be a major step forward towards transparency, transparency and clarity in the European process.
(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because it makes perfect sense to discuss this.
Is this the economic development model that Europe should offer to its citizens?
In general, I do not allow the speakers to exceed the time allotted, but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela's statement was particularly important to us.
We want a properly designed approach based on new technologies, innovation and investment which, once implemented, will improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region.
This is indeed a major achievement, because without going into the issue of the clear legal basis for patients' rights, the directive recognises and opens up new opportunities for them to take better treatment.
Year after year, the Court of Auditors has been unable to approve the EU budget and I was concerned about the lack of control of taxpayers' money when I was the head of the Commission in 2002.
For me, that is both a huge challenge and a great honour.
To be honest, we must acknowledge our historic responsibility for climate change and that our emissions per person are still many times higher than those of China or India, for example.
I am sure that the following dialogue will be constructive.
We therefore regret the urgent need to safeguard fundamental freedoms, as in the case of Europol.
I agree with the Commission's proposal that a new simplified approach should be introduced for using European Social Fund (ESF) funds in order to be able to respond more quickly and effectively to the economic and social problems that Europe is facing.
Frankly, I would have voted against the proposed composition of the Commission but, together with the weak candidates, there are also many very good ones - including Polish candidate Janusz Lewandowski.
You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but in fact, in addition to the United Kingdom, there are 26 other Member States of the European Union, so you can understand that, although we are sensitive to the concerns that you expressed, we must also listen to other legitimate concerns.
I think we need to be careful about maintaining the neutrality of the EU's humanitarian action, even if sometimes difficult in crisis areas.
It recalls that the responsibility and credibility of the EU and the Member States require full monitoring of investigations, as well as the pressure exerted on NGOs involved in drafting the Goldstone report and the subsequent investigations, including reference to the restrictive measures imposed on them.
I also hope that this decision will help save fishing species that are disappearing.
I hope that you will not see my questions as a provocation but as support for reflection.
I am always willing - and, I hope, always have the opportunity - to come here and present our results, but we need to check the information first.
This result will strengthen the EU's negotiating position in international trade negotiations, especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations such as the World Trade Organisation.
When Europe speaks with one voice, the United States will also adopt the same goal.
I therefore personally support EU tobacco growers, at least as long as EU citizens continue to smoke.
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries are taking the problem more seriously than others.
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) separate from the EU structural policy.
The number of new infection cases continues to grow more quickly than treatment opportunities, and two thirds of those who needed treatment in 2009 have still not received any treatment, which means that 10 million people with the treatment needs had no access to the necessary effective treatment.
Indeed, if you recognise the dignity of every human being, we do not view minorities in any negative way.
I welcome the Commission's proposal for simplification of this fund.
All EU institutions should henceforth ensure that our budgets are aimed at helping individual people and businesses cope with the economic crisis and plan for recovery.
The fastest way to get them to heal, and much more effective and concrete than all the measures from above, is to give support to social initiatives and to actions conducted by cultural institutions and regional institutions.
To all those who are still struggling with this treaty today in the false belief that it strengthens the European Union, I would say that those who are fighting against this treaty actually strengthen our so-called partners or, if you like, our opponents.
Europe's transformation of global capitalism is a reversal that will stifle us all.
We will shortly have a TEN-T meeting in which the Commission will press for the development of a new transport network.
You will remember that it was a hard battle because the case was raised in the Court of Justice and the Commission - I must commend the Commission - was clear, clearer than the Council at that time, and we fully supported the Commission.
The first one asking for the floor this morning was Barry Madlener.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's thought about food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.
(DE) Mr President, the governments of the central EU Member States, the Commission and the European Central Bank have taken a clear line.
In fact, I would remind the House that there are still more than 20 million unemployed people in the European Union - the figure is probably closer to 25 million by now - which means that, in fact, it would be a kind of collective suicide to attract even more asylum seekers.
The Commission must impose sanctions, not the finance ministers.
Sri Lanka's economic recovery depends on foreign direct investment and financial support from the EU.
We fully support the aims of the vaccine initiative, but were unable to support the quote that refer to another parliamentary vote which, among other things, supports abortion and which goes against a previous explanation of vote that we have brought to Parliament's protocols.
The text is the result of a compromise reached following lengthy negotiations and improves the implementation of passenger rights without placing a heavy burden on carriers.
It is certainly high time that the'E' in EMU was filled with contents by establishing a true and effective economic union as the last step in European economic integration.
I have taken particular note of the subject of children's rights in foreign relations.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, for ten years now, the European Union has been trying to equip itself with legal instruments in the area of economic immigration.
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for overcoming the national administrative and technical obstacles blocking the marketing of construction products within the EU and for continuing to build a single market in this sector.
If we really want to achieve the objectives that we have set ourselves in our foreign policy in the treaties, then I believe that we still have a long way to go before we can send back migrants who are in the European Union illegally to Libya.
I therefore voted in favour of the resolution on European innovation partnerships within the framework of the'Innovation Union' flagship initiative, and I believe that we should all participate in innovation measures after that, as I have said, is very important for the future.
We have a newly elected UK government that has made commitments in this area.
The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 on specific measures in agriculture in favour of the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
Economic and environmental policies can go hand in hand and produce a positive outcome both for the environment and for jobs.
There are some countries that do not use all EU structural funds granted to them, leaving 30% or 40% unused.
I am therefore asking myself - although the Commission has said that it has the information and publishes it, that there is an obligation to publish it - why it was not known, for example.
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I support the proposal that an effective information campaign should be carried out to increase the visibility of the points of single contact.
It is curious that the Spanish Presidency calls on us to combat the economic crisis and to make the implementation of economic policy mandatory.
Today, I voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation in the area of unitary patent protection because I believe that the impasse in the Council on the use of languages is unjustified.
I repeat: the Treaty clearly states that a Member State cannot be forced to go into debt.
I would like to recall the common agreement of the European Parliament and the Council on appointing 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
Let me assure the European Parliament that we will continue to raise these issues, including at the highest level, and remind the People's Republic of China's international human rights obligations.
I hope and believe that with your votes you will pave the way for an agreement.
First of all, I regret the fact that the Commissioner's colleague, Mr McCreevy, is not here - I think that the season for blasphemy has perhaps restarted!
Perhaps you do not know that animal testing is needed, for example, to confirm this kind of claim.
What gives me some suspicion, Commissioner, is the significant influence of Cars 21 and industry in the process under way here.
We do not agree with this.
The EU planned support in 2007-2010 to promote democratic development and good governance in Moldova is more than EUR 50 million.
Of course, we cannot understand how it will be if an illegal worker is taking up work and the person who gives him the job to cover the worker's costs of housing and living in the end are punished.
I believe that this system of measurement, based on the affirmation of various parameters, will lead to political decisions becoming more appropriate to the needs of society and the economy in general.
At the same time, I would like to point out that political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional and directly linked to the lifting of the violation of freedom and the end of repression of participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists.
Finally, Baroness Ashton, you will be travelling to the Middle East.
Worse still, US Congress was hampered by adopting the law on the protection of US service staff just one month after the establishment of the ICC in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like briefly to explain that this report includes the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, referring to the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 19 June 2008, which aimed to allow the marketing of poultry meat suitable for being used as food, even after an anti-microbial reading.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my personal condolences to the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deep concern at the additional four Cuban prisoners and opposition activist, who themselves launched hunger strike in protest.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme for 2010-2014 on an area of freedom, security and justice (Stockholm Programme).
Not wasting one cent must be our motto.
The EU and, in particular, the Mediterranean countries have always been there to provide humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people, because the principle of solidarity with people living in difficult circumstances is so fundamental.
Often, workers themselves are isolated, and in that situation, it is often very difficult to access trade unions.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the two Commissioners and the Commission for their statements here today.
Although some amendments have been made to improve the report by Mrs Guillaume, it is nevertheless, in its present form, a real spore for abuse of the process, leading to the authorities being once again tried and to people who really need to get their dossier dealt with quickly.
It is our time and our responsibility to do everything with these words, I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their very fine work, which we all share.
We have completed an extremely comprehensive programme of some key, important reports.
The so-called social dumping poses a major threat to workers, as it undermines their rights in a fundamental way.
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, I should like to take account of what the Commissioner said about the assessment of all the proposals on an ex-ante study in this area, such as in the context of cooperation between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries and taking into account the particular nature of the area, so that there are criteria which all countries from the outset have to take into account and follow in any project.
We also need to raise the issue of Roma women, who are confronted with particular problems in terms of poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence, and also with the problems of young Roma, because their lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to enter the labour market at a time of economic crisis.
I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to extend the scope of its housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities in the Member States.
It is also a reminder of all political decision makers in their areas of competence that public authorities really play a role in maintaining real freedom of the press: they must be ready to protect freedom of expression and promote its development.
Mr President, I think the European Union has become far too large, too many cultures, and I simply do not trust at all that system and it will get worse.
It is a little too early to say the results of this evaluation and, as the honourable Member knows, every step in this process requires unanimity in the Council.
It is important to note that the prospect of European integration is the main driving force for Balkan countries to implement the necessary reforms, and it is also a factor affecting regional stability.
Now that advertising has taken on an even greater role, it is important that we lay down criteria allowing consumers and patients to be fully aware of the effects of these medicines.
It would be a small step, with the expression of Mr Armong, for the European funds, but a giant life for the European economy.
Thirdly, there are simply no gaps in security that people have claimed on repeated occasions will be created unless we vote in favour of the interim agreement.
Furthermore, the rapid expansion of the Internet and the increase in electronic commerce in recent years have led to an increase in online gambling services and cross-border issues that remain unresolved.
Everyone taking decisions in this area should have equal access to professional information on the country of origin of the applicant and the bodies to which an appeal can be made, and should also be applied to asylum seekers.
After all these years, I understand what significant step it has been in creating the only multinational parliament in the world elected by referendum.
The EU 27 Member States spend EUR 200 billion annually on defence, and this EUR 200 billion must be spent better than they have done in the past.
Together, we have made a difference.
In addition, we are going to work on services of general interest in this parliamentary term.
I therefore propose that we ask Mr Almunia, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, for example, because he was quite critical of certain countries during his term of office and then died about the problem in Greece.
In this respect, there is a huge need for reform in Turkey.
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, so now we should grant this aid to Lithuania.
spent fuel and radioactive waste (debate)
I will limit myself and mention only the most recent events, such as the removal of the Vinh Long rivits Catholics and the substitute for a public park, and the deployment of the Jungwife Maria from the Catholic cemeteries in Hanodozgar.
Furthermore, the EGF plays an important role in training workers, lifelong training, improving employment opportunities and integrating workers into the labour market.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes
For this reason, I am voting in favour of rejecting the Commission's proposal.
One is now in place and I voted in favour.
There is only one solution to this: growth.
