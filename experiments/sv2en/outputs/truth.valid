Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them.

President of the Commission. - Mr President, the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis.
The conclusions from the report debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight to us that importing agricultural produce from third countries has a much greater detrimental impact on the environment than internal production, which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, making it conducive to climate change.
Indeed, it is hard to accept that the countries being given these funds are unable to use them.
Dates of forthcoming sittings: see Minutes
Maritime institutions in Member States must work together much more closely in order to harmonise their training programmes, as well as offer opportunities for paid work placements and exchanges of experience with European maritime companies.
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe.
What we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers.
Frontex needs to be bolstered, and the EU also needs to force authorities in the Member States to fulfil their responsibilities.
I should like to add one point that no one, with the exception of Commissioner Almunia, has addressed so far.
The areas susceptible to the effects of climate change are mainly the following: water resources, agriculture, energy, forestry and biodiversity, and last but not least, the population's health.
Let me also express my personal, and the Commission's, sorrow on the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a gendarme as a consequence of the terrorist attacks last week.
Mr Piebalgs, congratulations on all that you are doing.
However, it is comforting that, in the wake of the opposition and concerns expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education on the downgrading of policies on education and training, especially at a time when unemployment is on the rise and is causing problems in numerous Member States of the European Union, the Committee on Budgets tabled the necessary amendments, which I supported, and increased the initial planned appropriations (for example, in the case of Article 150202 on lifelong learning programmes).
A minority government of a totally different political persuasion then took power, but nobody considered that a coup.
The fact that we, the international community, looked on as the issue of Abyei was left unresolved in the referendum is actually highly irresponsible and a recipe for war to start up again in future.
The case of the Romanian handball player Marian Cozma, brutally murdered by two members of Hungary's Roma community, shows us once again that crime knows no borders and that ignoring the problems of this community is counterproductive.
You have to have a sound EU food policy.
The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new political model in Europe, both in terms of the need to pool the resources of Member States in order to achieve optimum results, and of working on shared strategies and operations that will also make Europe into the political union its founding fathers dreamed of years ago.
That is the request we are making.
We all are, as Hungary has also been from the start, supporters of the single market.
Unavoidable climate change is forcing society and the European Union economy to accommodate to a new reality.
Individual countries will continue to promote internal stability and help find both socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions.
It has been a brilliant three-year love affair and, like most short-term love affairs, I am pleased to see it coming to an end.
The need for NATO to maintain continued vigilance and be supported, especially in Afghanistan at this present time, is essential.
Something will have to happen, however, and we will need to get things moving.
In this respect, common aspects will have to be dealt with, such as reduced VAT rates, exemptions from the scheme, the option to set a maximum rate and, last but not least, the place of taxation of intra-EU supplies.
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands: we have the largest youth unemployment and our motor industry was decimated, partly due to the European Union funding jobs in Slovakia that took away essential jobs from the Ryton plant.
It is essential to ensure that these fledgling institutions are not bullied into weakening or undermining key rules to reform the finance sector.
Enough is enough.
We should also facilitate the creation of a network of research centres that can share specialised infrastructure and exchange useful information and data.
Qimonda meets the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - Mr President, I very much welcome the idea of the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office, as the situation in third countries, especially in Africa and the Middle East, is continuously deteriorating.
Mr Severin has noted very well the strategic reciprocity that Europe needs a strong United States and the US needs a strong Europe.
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this stream of refugees will mean in terms of what proportion can be included in the resettlement programme.
I firmly believe that, in the near future, the Canadian authorities will make every effort to waive these visas.
At the end of the day, it was not a food inspector or an EU food safety agency that made the discovery, but the company itself.
Belarus (debate)
For this reason, we should use our vision of military capabilities with an emphasis on soft power and prevention to tackle a new agenda, one that had already existed, but which became clear in Munich, for President Obama's policies make it possible for us to enter a new era of disarmament negotiations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me this evening to present the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has been ready for some time now in the Committee on Budgets.
In September, the Members from the MoDem party did not vote in favour of Mr Barroso's appointment as President of the Commission, his track record not being such as to recommend his re-election.
By restructuring our agricultural policy, we can make sure that the focus is on good animal welfare, that animals live in conditions suitable for their species, and that the animals are strong and robust, on the principle that prevention is better than cure.
We now fear that if the scope of this directive is expanded, the directive will suffer exactly the same fate as the last attempt at introducing'Made in' origin marking - in other words, that it will once again be blocked by the Council.
(SL) Mr President, I would like to join with my fellow Members in proposing that politicians, Member States and the European Union put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their economic recovery efforts.
Countries such as the UK and the US, both with deficits in excess of 10%, will have to undergo significant adjustment in order to restore sustainability to their public finances.
We should keep matters separate, or else Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary, and I do not believe that that is his responsibility.
Clearly, there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China.
- Report: Jean-Marie Cavada
Besides the insult to wine growers who are pursuing a policy of quality, in particular in Provence, it would be unacceptable to legitimise a by-product resulting from the mixing of finished products and to permit misleading references to the rosé colour.
But there is a huge amount more to do.
What will happen is there will be job losses across rural Europe and a reduction in our food production capacity.
Let us also remember that despite these institutional matters, this Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is, of course, very much influenced by the need to move on climate change, the need to move on the financial crisis, the worry in Europe that we need a policy for job creation - a lot of important matters that need to be addressed.
May I stress, however, that we are well aware that a number of texts necessary for police and judicial cooperation will need to be given a new basis, thereby enabling Parliament to carry out its role as colegislator.
I would also like to applaud the rapporteurs for leaving out the ethical element, which will naturally fall within the scope of the Member States.
This is good, because it is the young people, after all, who are going to decide the future of Europe, but, on the other hand, we should remember those who have already made their own very significant contribution to the building of Europe.
In other words, we are devising an Economic Recovery Plan in which we give three and a half billion to the oligarchy of energy giants and not a single euro to the partners whose help we need to enlist for the change to green energy.
Fish quotas and stock management are essential in order to prevent the complete overfishing of inland waters and oceans.
We would have preferred to have seen Parliament's resources being increased by means of redistributions and measures to increase efficiency, rather than increasing the total budget.
In addition, this package could demonstrate how European institutions can cooperate in a responsible, efficient and constructive manner in such an important field.
I believe that a front-loading approach, as advocated by the Commission in its recast proposal, in other words, improving the first-instance procedures, will allow us to make real economies of scale in the medium term.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have produced a good report and we have succeeded in achieving a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading.
We do not wish to outsource European jobs to countries that do not have the same level of environmental requirements that we have here.
All the contributions were useful.
(LT) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating.
They have to work hard to achieve an understanding between 27 Member States, to reflect Europe's unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration.
Madam President, I speak as the European Parliament's Vice-President for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Ms Andrikienfor her excellent report.
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development.
At that time, the money was intended for just two types of projects, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, i.e. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and wind farms in the North Sea.
If it were proposed that money from the EGAF should be allocated to redundant workers in Britain, we would vote for it to be allocated and we would be criticised if we did not.
As regards the activities of the Court, we know that the Court is fully operational, but is still in its infancy.
It concerns our neighbours, and includes our closest neighbours, like Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as more distant ones like Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
I am very dedicated, together with my colleagues in the Commission, to have gender mainstreaming included in all the policies which we are going to present.
These projects will help eliminate differences in connections between systems in the European Union, and will make possible further optimal use of the European Union's own sources of energy.
What is more, this approach is policy based, and I think that Europe, above anything else, needs more policy, and this is certainly also one of our Parliament's responsibilities.
There is also the matter of FIFA's failure to introduce goal line technology when other sports have done so.
We are, after all, able to organise various kinds of training or workshops, during which we can provide real help in accessing EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas.
There are others who use the absence of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral deals with suppliers which often ignore the requirements of transparency and fair competition, not to mention European solidarity.
Furthermore, I welcome the fact that we have also succeeded in creating a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming.
In particular, many Member States have made considerable efforts to meet their obligations with regard to the Pact.
The aim is to enable the EU to respond to the great societal challenges that concern all Member States and to which they cannot respond alone (ageing population and health, energy, water and food supplies, sustainable development, climate change, and so on), as well as to develop the knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness.
While we will support the resolution tomorrow, I think there are some inconsistencies in this budget, and I would like to highlight what I consider to be two of the main ones.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Csibi, for his excellent work.
We will move further on governance issues for the global economy, notably on financial regulation and a timely follow-up to the G20 Pittsburgh Summit.
However, I would like to explore this issue in a little more detail.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 to provide additional support to workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market.
The underlying issue lies in the wish of Europeans no longer to accept the consequences of the freedom of establishment which would necessarily result from accession.
This is a thankless, difficult role.
This is right at the top of our list of priorities.
However, the EU's support is essential to ensure that country's independence.
The Israeli Government is continuing its colonisations by forced march, and this after it committed war crimes at the start of this year.
The evaluations and additional visits by expert teams have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area.
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has the five longliners it had before.
the increase of budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capacities which will contribute to a new arms race;
I would also like to stress the contradiction between the Pakistan Government's commitment to freedom of religion and its leading role in the organisation of Islamic countries in endorsing their'Combating Defamation of Religion' agenda at the United Nations.
I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion.
I find that the compromise which the Council has reached is a good one, because it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment.
In these circumstances, rapid, coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions is an absolute must, such as introducing programmes for returning old cars against a consistent reduction in the purchase price of a new one, financial assistance and so on.
In my view, the proposed legal basis is correct, but it does not seem to be very consistent with the more than significant entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, when the functions and powers currently shared between the two pillars will be consolidated.
Madam President,'success or failure, that is the question'.
Such a policy is destined to fail if those people working in the fishing industry, from the fishermen to the traders who sell fish to consumers, do not comply with the rules.
this expensive, ineffectual talking shop of a parliament, masquerading as an elaborate illusion of accountable democracy, a monstrous deceit on the electors who sent us here.
This is unfortunate, because it would seem that on this question we ought to be united.
We no longer say that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100% of our industries in Europe, where, in a way, we do not care, because the climate issue must take precedence.
A debt burden - the painful evidence of which we are witnessing - stands in the way of economic growth, not only in our European countries, but also in the United States.
Moreover, this report will help clarify the various aviation agreements and process them in the simplest way, and it states which criteria we should pay attention to and which aspects we should keep track of.
I will be voting for the telecoms package, but I do so with a certain reluctance, because I believe there has been a fundamental betrayal, at the highest level, of the basic principle of the telecoms liberalisation that this directive was supposed to achieve.
(PT) Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, we are facing an unprecedented crisis.
They will have a greater impact and a lower cost to the taxpayer if we are able to coordinate our efforts.
The European Commission is preparing a directive to make it easier for Belarusians to obtain EU visas and an agreement on readmission.
Let me give a specific example.
Let us take a look, for example, at the upbringing of children and at schools.
Neither do we yet know if the standards we are promoting on the legal trade in timber will come into force and operate globally - some speakers have already called attention to this problem.
Setting up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a body to analyse and evaluate the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to support sustainable qualitative growth is crucial.
in writing. - I voted to change the rules on vaccination against bluetongue disease in order to allow the use of more effective vaccines and to reduce red tape for farmers.
I voted in favour of this report insofar as it launches an appeal to set up strong, integrated EU policies.
By abstaining, I wish to express my deepest disappointment with the result of the summit, which was well below our citizens' expectations.
Late payment frequently causes difficulties both on the internal market and in cross-border trade.
Of course, we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour, no one is disputing that, but we should not insist that the citizens make all of the effort, since they are our only chance of coming out of this crisis on top.
In the United States, they have an early-warning system to that end.
One of those cases is my own constituent Andrew Symeou.
Together we must defend our rights, our freedoms and our democracy.
Speed things up: that is what Europeans asked for in electing this Parliament and that is what we must give them if, in five years' time, we wish to see more of them turn out to vote.
The parts of the text for which the European Council is competent were discussed and agreed by the European Council itself.
Private final consumption expenditure per capita increased by more than 80% over the last decade.
At this point in time, I believe that it would be useful to engage in effective reflection on the proper ways to enforce the existing legislation.
The conclusions of the summit in this regard are very vague.
To this end, the proposal offers uniform instruments permitting enforcement or precautionary measures in order to avoid problems of recognition and translation of instruments emanating from other Member States, and a standard form for the notification of documents relating to the claims on the territory of another Member State.
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because the important policy areas and the individual opinions have been taken into account.
The Commission can support Member States by financial programmes to cooperate at a European level.
For example, the Council decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 established the capacity for the Member States to cooperate at national, intergovernmental level to prosecute these crimes, which fortunately - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet - are even part of the legislation in some Member States.
Thank you.
My vote should not be perceived as support for the EU's' subsidy gravy train', either.
Our purchases are increasingly remote and the Internet has now completely changed our habits, partly because our lives have become increasingly frenetic.
As regards information, we are supplying continuous information as we receive it.
Finally, I would like to say that the best investment is an investment in the education of the young generation, and I mean lifelong education.
We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere.
I am delighted that these issues have been satisfactorily resolved in the final agreement with the Council.
(Applause from the centre left)
In this case, there are thousands of people involved, often with small children and without the appropriate funds.
The procedures are completely different when it comes to appealing to the Commission under the provisions of the possible future Treaty, and appealing to Parliament via the petitions procedure.
Human rights must be respected by all sides in the Middle East conflict.
Mr President, the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area.
We all need to face up to our responsibilities.
We understand that UNESCO has, in any event, made representations to the Chinese authorities concerning the impact of the development on Kashgar's traditional heritage and culture.
in writing. - MEP Schwab has proposed a report which aims to increase car safety through the introduction of increased safety measures requirements for car manufacturers.
I therefore voted against this report.
The economic and financial crisis hit us hard but we have shown the ability to act and we have strengthened our resistance.
If we talk about Parliament's position with external bodies, for example, with human rights organisations which could be affected by this and if we fail to come to an agreement, although I hope that this is not the case, and if individual projects cannot then take place, I believe that there is support and understanding for Parliament's position.
These Thursday afternoon sittings are taking a more and more surreal turn in this House, both in the emptiness that we observe and in the subjects addressed and the way in which they are dealt with.
I believe that it is still completely unclear as to whether Moldova will manage to elect its president and if this does not happen, the country will obviously go ahead with new elections next year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999, and 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency at the same time.
(EL) Madam President, I, too, would like to endorse and welcome the present compromise, because it raises the question of democratic deficits which women in particular have had to face for years, when they help their self-employed husbands in trade, in handicrafts, in small and medium-sized enterprises and in the liberal professions, without any recognition over the years for their work.
Of course, our political choices are manifestly different and are sometimes at odds with one another.
I would call it climate justice, because this is about the relation between developing and developed countries and the will to present a credible proposal for the financing of both mitigation and adaptation measures and the way we also show our willingness to lead the way.
I would therefore also like to know where the Commission stands on this issue.
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks, which profited from the aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach.
Not only do I have three children but I also have a grandchild who at the moment drinks nothing but milk.
We are prepared to put together technical assistance programmes which will accompany the difficult austerity measures the Greek authorities have to go through.
We are waiting for it to be produced by the Commission.
As you say, we need to refresh our statistics all the time, and Eurostat is looking at this.
Sometimes, I wonder if we have not sufficiently learnt the lessons regarding the consequences of our course of actions, if we do not follow European solutions to European problems and try to find something specific even though we have to deal with it collectively.
The emails also reveal that scientists sceptical of the hypothesis have been squeezed out of peer review processes to avoid flaws in research being revealed to public scrutiny.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this timely debate.
The Internet has perhaps shone a light on this very dark part of society which we are still grappling with, and grappling very badly with.
We do know the sort of people we are dealing with here and the institutions thus need to be aware, in relation to inspections, that they represent a higher risk and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections.
Our priority during work on the review of the RoHS Directive was to raise safety standards for electrical appliances and electronic gadgets for sale in the European Union.
Preventative work is being done chiefly in schools, because that social group is the most vulnerable to drug dependence.
It enlarged successfully to reunite the continent at the end of the Cold War, and now it is called upon to preserve previous achievements and continue integration once better times come again.
There are many Members who want questions answered tonight and out of respect for them, we would like to conduct this in an orderly manner.
But those of us who were involved in it knew there was no alternative, that the dairy problems had to be resolved, and hopefully we are now on the way to resolving some of the problems that part of the sector faced.
Secondly, whilst the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity provisions, we have chosen to abstain from such references in this report because we oppose any family policy being dictated at EU level; this is a matter for national governments to decide upon.
Last but not least, I believe that the next talks we hold on this subject must deal with the issue of EUBAM Rafah: how to revive this mission and how it can possibly be extended.
So the Commission is monitoring the situation and, if there is the need, the Commission will act, but I think we should not go beyond the structures that are in Community law and the Commission will definitely stay within Community law.
Since our shared vision is to see a real European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations, which we will discuss today and vote on tomorrow, are of paramount importance.
in writing. - In light of the persisting gap between men and women in terms of employment rates, wages and access to management positions, I call on Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC, while ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed in the national legislation.
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission.
I really want to try and get from the Commissioner the fact that no further progress will be made now, in the next few weeks, unless these fugitives are delivered.
We will address this issue soon, with the discussions on the recasting of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport.
The European Parliament has adopted today, Wednesday 20 October, the report by its Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis.
There is already talk of increased taxes in the near future to keep public finances afloat.
Today, the time has come for us to be vocal in our demands for Christians and followers of other religions to be free to practise their religion.
Across the EU, 31.5% of women work part time (30 hours or less per week), compared with just 8.3% of men.
I share the cautious optimism of both the Commission Member and the Minister and feel that the skies are clearing, but that there are still many clouds.
At the time, few of us could have guessed the scale of the coming economic crisis.
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction, showing that it is on the side of consumers.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this sterling report.
This policy has become a key feature of the economic recovery package, providing added value and supporting efforts promoting modernisation and sustainable economic growth, thereby demonstrating European solidarity at the same time.
It is also unfortunate that we do not yet know if and when the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force, and we clearly need to bring it into force without further hesitation.
However, I feel the situation clearly demonstrates the dire straits of the agriculture industry, certainly in my region, if farmers have to queue for days outside, during winter months, in an attempt to secure modest sums of EU funding.
The Southern European Member States have left it too late.
This should be done by implementing smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy.
On behalf of our citizens, we will express our will in a democratic vote, and so tomorrow is a very important day.
It has to be said that the provision of a house is an absolute necessity for everybody, particularly in the modern welfare state.
In my view, defining priorities that are political means that they should be scrutinised, should be transparent and should be democratic.
This particular project deals with the deployment of the traffic management system.
(HU) During recent months, a climate of fear has reigned again in Vojvodina in northern Serbia among the several nationalities which live there, mainly Hungarians.
What we are going to vote on, today, is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I do understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved, on our behalf, a result which is practicable and feasible.
in writing. - Whilst we agree with those parts of the proposal that provide for the equal treatment of Parliament with the Council with regard to access to meetings and to information; for regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of the Parliament; cooperation on citizens' initiatives; impact assessments on legislation; and the use of'soft law' (rather than punitive law?); we disagree with: a reaffirmation and strengthening of compulsory time limits for the implementation of directives; and the use of congratulatory language about the European Union and its officers.
You all know that there cannot be broadcasting without access to radio spectrum, and it is the EU policy to ensure that all players on the market get non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum.
This will provide us with a general and fairly comprehensive framework for action by the Commission regarding progress on equality between men and women in the areas which my fellow Member has just mentioned, from employment through to the other ways in which it is important to ensure and guarantee such equality.
We look forward to the other political and economic heavyweights also putting bids on the table, which has not been the case up to now for several of them.
Dementia and Alzheimer's disease in particular are not only serious medical problems, but also a hugely sensitive ethical and social problem, the severity of which will continue to increase in relation to the ageing of Europe's population.
I should also like to state that you took great care to point out that we should not confuse the various responsibilities, and I certainly do not wish to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union, either.
rapporteur. - Mr President, may I first begin by thanking my shadow rapporteurs, who have got to grips with the detail of this issue: Mr Szájer, Mr Duff, Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl.
We have given them our hand and, with the full support of all the European institutions, please, Minsk, take it, because you and the Belarus people have a lot to win.
We must monitor what is happening closely, because the President said that we would have an annual saving of EUR 38 billion from European companies.
Now, following the judgment against Liu Xiaobo, we have even seen a homosexual party banned by the police, which clearly threatens to result in a political ice age in China for dissidents, human rights defenders and homosexuals.
(SL) Commissioner, your report on Ukraine today was very clear.
We must acknowledge here that this will only happen if the parliaments are involved, because it is only through the parliaments that the majority of regulations can be suitably adapted, and that this process and the proposals in connection with the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are of paramount importance.
Someone spoke about helicopters.
Madam President, Commissioner, I was very pleased to see you here and hear you speak.
That is what I would like to highlight in this agreement.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who assist their spouses in their self-employed work.
Anyone who has been to Gaza after the conflict can testify to the people's enormous suffering.
(ES) Madam President, the relationship with the United States is, strategically speaking, the European Union's most important relationship.
I have to say that our ambition is to achieve political agreement at the June European Council.
However, we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money.
At the same time, the large number of participants at the meeting in Copenhagen fills me with hope that the action of such a large number of allies will ultimately have a chance of success.
Mr President, I wish to speak in support of the motion for there not to be a resolution because I heard Mr Schulz say something which, in my view, is very important: if we really want this debate to encompass' Europe'and not just Italy, there is no point then voting on a resolution entitled' Freedom of information in Italy'.
I have thus decided to vote in favour of this report.
This recommendation by Parliament proposes to approve the regulation offered by the Council and not to delay any further because the new regulation would simplify the administration of procedures and would guarantee the equal treatment of legally resident third-country nationals in the field of social security.
That is quite a shocking figure and it is a figure that I mentioned in a report I drew up in the previous mandate of this Parliament.
But an EU Arctic policy is perhaps not so bizarre as the appointment of the supremely unqualified Baroness Ashton, the Sarah Palin of the ex-student Left, as High Representative.
One such achievement is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October, which is, quite simply, the most ambitious commercial agreement ever concluded by the European Union, and which must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral commercial agreements.
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations.
I think, with regard to the car industry, that we have placed far too little importance on the development of completely new types of car, cars that run on hydrogen, battery-powered cars and cars driven by fuel cells.
We shall then go our separate ways.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union.
As a partner to Thailand, the European Union is ready to support the country, as far as it is able, during this complex process.
Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth, is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries, it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension, where necessary.
This is what the Commission and Council are doing right now in a very commendable way so as to ensure that the gas supplies are back on track as quickly as possible; threatening with legal action is not a very effective course of action, of course.
It is indispensable that Member States investigate without delay the extreme human rights abuses against Roma women, penalise the perpetrators and ensure that all victims are identified and provided redress.
(LT) Mr President, this really is a rather complex issue.
I would like to draw attention to the significance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies, but also - and this has not been spoken about - the significance of cooperation with national parliaments and, in particular, with committees for European affairs, budgets and budgetary control.
My suggestion to you would be that, now that the European External Action Service is putting in place its rules on access to information and access to documents, please make this a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens and which does not deal with foreign policy as if it were only the domain of some secretive diplomats.
All countries are currently amending their economic policies with the aim of getting out of the unfavourable economic situation as quickly as possible, and into at least some level of economic growth.
And let me tell you about the Japanese people too.
Mr Barroso said in response to this that it was an internal matter.
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened, but rather preserved and strengthened.
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity derive directly from the Christian tradition.
Whilst it is useful to the big corporations, it is dislocating public transport and is responsible for the declining state of the network and of safety.
On the other hand, discussion of Turkey's future membership of the EU cannot be left to one side.
This risk must be managed effectively and, as the tragic events in Japan remind us, as a matter of urgency.

As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it.
Nevertheless, this is not what is happening, a sad example of which is the situation in Lampedusa.
Israel is bombing and decimating a ghetto.
It is important to listen to people's views, but it is also important to learn from experience.
in writing. - The issue of the CAP and global food security is important.
I wish to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate.
It needs to be a partnership based on respect for one another, for our common commitments and also for the values that the European Union stands for when it comes to human rights, democracy and the principle of the rule of law.
It accounts for 3% of the EU's GDP and generates a commercial surplus of EUR 35 billion.
In this regard, we, as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, tabled an amendment that calls - not only with reference to Europe, of course, we are very much addressing the United States as well, as the Commissioner is well aware - for all forms of export subsidies to be completely abolished, and in short order.
Most contributors emphasise the necessity of turning CAP into, or concentrating on, competitiveness of European agriculture, responsiveness to climate change, food safety and quality requirements, and other environmental objectives.
We also believe that negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit, which is to be held in May.
The next item is the joint debate on

I also appreciated the positive evaluation in the motion on FYROM's continuous efforts to stabilise the region.

We have been in contact hourly with those in Tunisia and with the people in Egypt, with our delegations, to whom I pay tribute for what they have had to deal with in the last couple of weeks, and also in direct contact with the government and with the services.
I am, in fact, convinced that this financial instrument takes on even greater significance in the light of the financial crisis because it can help businesses recover more effectively and can, in the future, constitute a pilot project for the creation of a more generous energy fund.

After consulting consumer-rights organisations and representatives from the business world, I understand that we must insist on yet greater harmonisation of consumer rights across the European Union.
I have said that anyone who asks questions is the bad guy in this debate.
This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor negotiations - in this case, trade negotiations - and to intervene politically using the parliamentary means at its disposal, such as hearings, resolutions and oral questions, in order to stay informed on the progress of these negotiations.
There is no acknowledgement of the citizens' investment in social cohesion or solidarity between the generations.
The true reform, however, lies with admissibility.

For this purpose, appropriate financial resources must be made available which will allow opportunities to be taken and new sources of global competitiveness to be exploited by the EU.
In many countries in Europe, when the public authorities are in a difficult situation, they are known to generally pay late and very often cause some companies to go bankrupt.
The G20 Conference also made the dismantling of tax havens one of the key objectives.
There is no such response from the political class.
Of course, the dollar remains king for global transactions, still providing a safe investment, but the colossal debts accumulated by the United States in getting the rest of the world to finance their lifestyle will increasingly sow the seeds of doubt as to the ability of the number one economic power to honour its commitments.
We have to ensure that a free society has the right tools and the right measures in order to fight and defeat those who would destroy it.

However, it is a problem which will export the fight against international terrorism into the neighbouring countries and regions for as long as fighting in Afghanistan continues.
We must fight against fragmentation, and so I urge Commissioner Andor to keep the European Social Fund intact in the regulations, and not to split it up as is sometimes suggested in this House.
Of course, it is in the nature of things that we do not get everything we want in a compromise.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, and the three rapporteurs, Mr Surján, Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug, for their constructive attitude throughout the budgetary procedure, which also demonstrates the very good cooperation that we have enjoyed in this work.
on behalf of the S & D Group. - (LT) The Social Democrat Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia.

I therefore also appeal once again for 25 May, the date of his execution, to be designated the International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism, because many unknown people, who just like Pilecki lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms, deserve to be remembered.
Let me briefly touch on what we have done.
If this were to become the majority opinion in the European Union in the next parliamentary term, it would destroy the heavily-financed peace plan set up after the Balkan wars.

Speaking as rapporteur, I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and is incapable of tackling crime prevention for several reasons.

The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make wage austerity a permanent fixture.

I am voting in favour of the report on establishing a new microfinance facility which will help people whose jobs are at risk to set up or develop micro-enterprises.
It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák's report, with which I strongly agree, and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programmes as operational programmes capable of giving a new quality to cohesion policy.
During the trialogue negotiations, it became clear to me that the improvements put forward by me on behalf of Parliament are essential for fair and effective energy markets.
In the current economic crisis, it is of the utmost importance that the self-employed be supported and encouraged.

I voted in favour of this report because the food programme whose extension is being considered is a key instrument for helping the deprived who are suffering a great deal in the current economic crisis, even when it comes to meeting basic needs.
in writing. - (LT) Most industrialised countries, including all EU Member States, have at least one officially supported Export Credit Agency (ECA), and these collectively account for the world's largest source of official financing for private-sector projects.
Therefore, we are not voting in favour of the report.
By taking this position, we helped to destroy this joint government.
By creating the Conseil français du culte musulman in 2003, Mr Sarkozy, then Minister of the Interior, introduced Islam into France's institutions.

The costs will be paid by the country of origin.
I am thinking in particular of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system.
The decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is especially important to stability in the area.
Therefore, we can expect a reactor accident to happen every 25 years.
In my view, this increased eligibility of housing for expenses cofinanced by the ERDF must lead us to consider other possible developments, in the medium and long terms, whether it be in terms of funding eligibility or of the earmarking of funds for certain strategic priorities.
Today, the time has come to talk once again about the violation of religious rights in both of those countries, this time against Christians.
Climate change: one of the greatest threats our planet faces.
Of course, a huge emphasis, as I would expect, was placed on human rights - the importance of making sure that is clearly part of all the dynamic relationships that we have and encompasses our work.
I must also say that so far, the European Union has no jurisdiction at all in regulating air traffic.
However, Europe is not a crutch or a cure for an economic crisis.
I can thus confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission in relation to comitology and the optional provisions.
I do not think that any of the warm words expressed here today, even those expressed by the Commission, can change the facts that the European Union has no presence in Libya and that, at the moment, it is not even able to put a stop to the crisis in the cities or the actions of Mr Gaddafi's ground troops.
For this reason I firmly believe that if the European Parliament approves these two regulations it will greatly benefit EU citizens because they will have the possibility to exercise much greater choice.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I share the hope that measures will be agreed at the European Council to reassure the markets and reintroduce stability to the eurozone, because, whether we are members or not, we should all have an interest in that.
Pre-accession assistance funding has proved to be especially susceptible.
That is a cause for great thanksgiving and joy.
We therefore call for an end to the war and to violence by all parties, and we urge the EU to act accordingly.
The world outside of Europe is facing the energy challenge head on.
The indicator for measuring the energy efficiency of buildings must be included in advertisements for sale or rental that appear in the media.
It is essential to encourage the efforts aimed at increasing EU investments with regard to diversification of cross-border structures, incentives for generating alternative, non-conventional forms of energy at local level and improvements in the infrastructure's ability to facilitate connection to new energy sources.
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the efficient functioning of the internal market which, consequently, leads to a growth in internal demand and economic activity.
Secondly, we should consider creating a rapid reaction tool within the ENP for prompt and flexible response to political changes in partner countries, as has happened recently in the Southern neighbourhood.
I believe that the fact that someone here in Parliament who supports Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission is simply grotesque.
The problem is, therefore, that the only Members listening to you are those who can do so in the original language.
We have lost a lot of money.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciated the fact that the Swedish Presidency emphasised issues that concern our fellow citizens, our electorate, namely the environment and climate change, the financial crisis, the safeguarding of jobs and the fight against crime, because, in order to do a good job, we need to be in harmony with those who voted for us.
The EU budget cannot, as some MEPs argue, be used as a supplement to national budgets in a time of austerity; rather, it should reflect the difficult situation in which EU Member States find themselves.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Treaty has not conferred any power on the Council to deal with national constitutions of the Member States.
It is not business as usual.
You can call me a cynic, but students do not always come to study and tourists do not always visit for a limited period.
Is the global financial crisis, which turned into the economic crisis, the cause of this situation, or are we dealing, here, with our own mistakes, neglect and lack of action?
My second'but' has to do with the role which the Belgian Presidency has played in the post-Lisbon period.
The primary objective of these regimes was and is to hold together the territory of this enormous state, which is inhabited by a range of completely different peoples.
(PL) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe, we are still struggling with its negative consequences.
That is pretty much the case in many areas with Japan, but I recognise Japan's right, for instance, to protect its rice market, to protects its rice farmers, to pay its farmers higher prices than those on world markets and to say no to massive imports which would obliterate its peasant farmer population, in the same way that I recognise our economies' rights to protect certain sectors of their activity.
(ES) Mr President, I am going to talk about two concepts, namely coordination and flexibility.
For instance, only 15% of older people use the Internet.
I am therefore determined to work in this new strategy to reinforce the social priority, as I already said to you when we discussed the broader political guidelines for the next mandate.
Therefore, Commissioner, I will get straight to the point by asking you what measures - and I use the plural here - the Commission intends to take in the short term to deal with these shortcomings.
That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens.
It does not interest the citizens, and quite rightly so.
(The sitting was closed at 00.10)
I hope that Parliament sends a strong signal, approving by a very wide majority the report by Mrs Muscardini, whom I thank, together with the shadow rapporteur, Mr Susta.
At the same time, Romania has supported the open-door policy, aimed especially at strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine.
I firmly believe that everything must be done on top of this to avert the consequences of the disaster and rebuild living conditions.
I am also clearly referring not only to accidents at work, which occur fairly frequently, but also to hazardous substances used in work processes.
In September 2009, the Council started the detailed examination of the proposal to amend the decision on establishing the European Refugee Fund.
At this time it is important to have special consideration for the island and outermost regions which, in addition to their permanent obstacles, are now confronted with devastated infrastructure and personal, commercial and agricultural property, and, in many cases, not being able to resume normal activities immediately, particularly in the regions that depend almost exclusively on tourism, as the media portrayal of the events could deter potential visitors.
We have not seen such sustained disruption to the industry with such enormous financial losses since 9/11 and, notwithstanding the financial difficulties currently facing all Member States, I would urge them to back plans to support an industry which simply cannot sustain further losses.
At the same time, we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing.
Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is horrific.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to make a minor linguistic, and perhaps semantic, observation.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)

The problem is not the Turkish Cypriots, as some people have been saying.
I would ask the Commission what they are doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their countries of origin, without having to undergo long and distressing journeys to consuming countries.
This is what we have to do.
I genuinely wonder, ladies and gentlemen, where the human rights defenders have gone who are happy, as we are, that the West is secular and pluralist, and who shamefully avert their gaze before a Middle East that, little by little, is being reserved for a single religion.
This is being done and we are in dialogue with the authorities from these countries.
Mr President, bankers who squander our money are despicable, but Mr Schulz, politicians who now run up deficits and debts on the back of younger generations are just as irresponsible.
For this, I owe my thanks to the French and Czech Presidencies, the Commission and the rapporteurs from the individual Groups.
We believe that it is up to the Member States to deliver now.
Mr President, the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in relation to the Instrument for democracy and human rights was good; the relationship was very cooperative, in fact.
We should endeavour to ensure that the programmes which are offered give the greatest possible support to the reforms being undertaken in these countries to bring them closer to the Union.
It is also very important for every Member State to maintain national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information, i.e. about the availability of healthcare, procedures and the required documentation.
In earlier times, we experienced any events in Soviet Union as ideological pressure but now we discuss trade under conditions of absolute individual freedom.
Irrespective of whether this is deemed to be a private or a public fund, this report is about a very specific matter, namely Parliament establishing, firstly, that it has no legal claim to have its deficits subsidised and, secondly, that, furthermore, no such subsidising of deficits will take place.
Surely theirs must be the most expensive faces since that of Helen of Troy which launched a thousand ships.
Aid that leads to a distortion of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have negative consequences for both employment and technical development.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, there are a few things that I think we should bear in mind in the forthcoming debate.
You have already heard various Members say that we want to see a more robust Stability and Growth Pact with a reverse voting mechanism.
(FR) Having said all that, I do think it is very important to remind ourselves of the real issues at stake here.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 (8))
To show solidarity with the campaign to stop this barbaric ritual, I would encourage you all to wear a rose petal today to symbolise our opposition to this practice.
Democratic control is being side-lined, inasmuch as national governments are hiding behind the Commission and the Troika on the most basic measures, while the Commission is referring these matters to the national governments.
A new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (continuation of debate)
Following threats from the Commission about legal action in the European Court of Justice, Sweden has now begun to permit deca-BDE.
It is apparent to those of us who are from rural constituencies, and those who sit on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that the current position that many livestock farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable.
Savers deserve transparent information, which is easy to understand and available.
I believe it could be our job to support the Chinese people in their realisation of a harmonious society.
I supported these two mechanisms during the vote because I am convinced that we must be demanding and ambitious in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe and thus to safeguard our future.

I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world.
Now the effects of globalisation have been completely overwhelmed by the financial and economic crisis and our measured reaction is the adjustment of the funding criteria of the EGF.
in writing. - (PT) The present resolution records Kosovo's declaration of independence on 17 February 2008, which was recognised by 69 countries, and encourages Member States to work together in their joint approach to Kosovo, bearing in mind Kosovo's planned accession to the EU.
Compared to either of the other institutions, Parliament can still be considered to lead the way when it comes to transparency and so I would not make it my top priority, since with regard to both the accessibility of documents and to the transparency of its sittings and the activities of the Members of the European Parliament, we are more open than any national parliament.
It was internal policymaking by Italy's minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi.
The alerts from the Human Rights Observatory in Asturias - my region - and from many other organisations deserve to be taken seriously.
I vote in favour of Mr Casini's report.
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution relating to the banning of porcine and bovine thrombin.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism.
(The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m.)

Turning to the second question, I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission is aware that the control of AMR requires a multi-disciplinary approach.
Yesterday's trialogue gives a lot of hope for final agreement.
Future projections, based on an annual growth rate of roughly 27% in the coming years, indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015.
However, I believe that the proposal's legal basis should be adapted so that the text takes the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision.
Many people ask me what ACTA stands for, and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeit Trading Agreement.
I voted for this report, since this EU financial assistance will help people who have become victims of globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and will help them to escape the grip of the recession.
Given that the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions and development and knowledge for citizens in cultural terms, particularly through the broadcasting of audiovisual content, I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in the radio spectrum and in the creation of development and innovation software.
And all this compounds the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe, and about the problems that would be caused by the admission of a country that shares borders with over 80 million inhabitants: factors that will continue to reinforce my unshakable conviction that it is not right for Turkey to enter a Europe whose unity depends, above all else, on the spirit of Christianity.
Thank you, Mr President.
(Protests from the floor)
That means going against the environment and consumer safety, because old, high-energy consumption and potentially dangerous equipment would be put back on the market.
Thank you for your attention and I am looking forward to the debate.
I wanted to put on record my thanks to the Mayor of Balingen, Dr Reitemann, and the local council for allowing the memorial to be laid in honour of the lives of these young men.
Thirdly, I have a huge request to Mrs Kroes to speed up digitisation in Member States, if we want to be proud of this great flagship project in the future.
Anyone who experienced and saw the results of the environmental catastrophe caused by the failure of the technology in Baia Mare, and the subsequent release of toxic cyanide effluents into water courses, with far-reaching effects on fauna in the Tisza River in Hungary, as well as the Danube in Bulgaria, would do everything possible to ensure that something similar could never happen again in the European Union.
This is everyone's responsibility: it is the responsibility of the Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
In the future, climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion per year.
