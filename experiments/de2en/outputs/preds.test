The financial and bureaucratic expenditure associated with the failure of the policy of multilingualism will only grow larger with renewal of the EU.

As far as production and employment are concerned, only a few nutrition sectors remain in the middle and upper segments, luxury and high technology today.

I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and look forward to further progress in these relations.

I think that we can expect a whole series of initiatives which call on the Commission to do more and demand a more committed Europe, and without doubt the Commission will respond with enthusiasm to this demand.
And this issue is important for the Digital Agenda because, if we do not live up to our responsibilities and not follow a clear line, then we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier: we need to be aware of the fact that in 2020 - and that is what we set out in the Digital Agenda - every European has to be able to ultimately pursue its interests about the opportunities of spectrum use.

As a form of primary prevention, I nevertheless call for the implementation of measures to promote healthy lifestyle as a fundamental factor in improving health.

Look at it and fight again for democracy.

All these are examples of the benefit of animal research.
Documents received: see Minutes

I would also like to remind our liberal colleagues, and particularly Mr Rohde, that the reason he favours free trade is due to the destructive effects of free trade, as he said that the fact that British citizens were guided by Dutch interests was not significant: it was therefore not appropriate for Indian society to be destroyed in order to speed up the collapse of the world revolution.

I think that the transition to a sustainable and environmentally friendly economy will proceed without introducing excessive legislative measures.
Everyone seems to forget what the US and, of course, NATO's contribution to peace in Europe.

This report sets out guidelines on the way air agreements should be analysed in terms of their content and procedures.
The language law creates an imbalance.
Perhaps the British domestic political discussion, once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force on 1 December, can also be left outside this Chamber.

It is a system based on real policies and directives, and now, Mr Michel, on protagonists and on liberal rhetoric that has led to the current situation: promoting the agro-industrial model according to the protection of the interests of the large food industry and the resulting qualitative impoverishment of the global agricultural industry; many years of insufficient investment in agriculture, in the promotion of the arable agricultural sector, in the world and in the promotion of large farmers' small and small industries.
Economically, the proportion paid to producers is less than their production costs, and the CAP must ensure that this problem is resolved.
Once again, I urge the Commission, in its contacts with the government, to keep to this promise until it stands in the legislator in the Congo.

I believe that this procedure and strengthening the food safety of the EU public provide greater clarity for those Member States and third countries that export meat products to the EU.
In view of this, it seems that deadly to aim for an Mercosur agreement, especially as the Swedish Institute for Food and Technologies has pointed out that the ecological footprint of Brazilian beef can be 35-times greater than that of Irish beef.
Therefore, in accordance with the agreement with the Council, the following text should be supplemented at the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, which is Article 1, point 2 (b) of the amending regulation:'The same reference rate applies to the annual adjustment of tariffs laid down in Articles 4a, 4b and 6a (b), provided that these same fees are regulated in the euro'.

Similarly, individual Member States have the decision to sign or ratify the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages, the two most important instruments introduced by the Council of Europe.

Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, that people who are already in a work-life are protected and supported to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and then have to go one or two years through retraining and training to find another job; to safeguard the existing jobs that exist.
Madam President, there has also been talk about our citizens having to be made clear about the advantages and opportunities they can expect from such an action package.

We also see some of them again and there is also an attempt to follow this logistical approach, which has not been entirely successful as we have imagined, but is on the right track.
At this point, I would like to take the opportunity once again to thank the Commission - sometimes it was a bit cumbersome - for the Council here, in night meetings and in many trialogue meetings, we have tried to find reasonable solutions, because they have now agreed to the reasonable compromise that we found before an hour ago.

We clearly need an energy mix from different energy sources that is as broad as possible, because it stabilises the energy situation and thus puts the diversity of every nation and of Europe into practice.

By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I clearly express my full support for the Tunisian people and for the historic democratic revolution they have begun.

My question concerns Pakistan, whose chronic instability is, as we know, a factor in the crisis for the whole region and also Afghanistan.

Last week, I accused the Belgian Presidency of the committee that it was only a hostage chairman.

It is a matter of creating such a mechanism, but it must also be accessible and understandable to EU citizens so that they can make full use of it.

I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will see that the current constructive approach of work with the European Union is much more effective than the attempt to reclaim history.
Only how it may be that, to date, the European Commission has not found the necessary arguments or the time to influence the Latvian Government in order to end discrimination against language.

This will be an effective instrument for curbing illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
Yes, that is fine, that is legitimate, we have fought.

The main objective of aid for trade is to increase the domestic and international competitiveness of these 48 states.
Even if we accept the rationality of the internalisation of external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately indispensable to only punish heavy goods vehicles and not the normal cars to diminish traffic congestion, just as the old'polluter pays' principle is clearly applied discriminatory.
I would like to thank you for the understanding and support shown in this plenary debate.
Although we look at the starting point, we have some concerns.

There are the large distributors who are very much present on the markets of some Member States and then the many small dealers who welcome our current proposal more than they have been since 2002 because, in many ways, they have not protected their interests, in other words, from the legislator in 2002, but have made it harder for them to keep competition through the large traders.
It must build the EU's' regional policy partnership'to promote peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', which the Committee on Development launched by adopting its report in April 2007.

This is indeed a great achievement, provided that this directive recognises the full rights of patients and opens up a new range of ways of getting better treatments for them.
There is no year in which the Court of Auditors gives us the satisfaction to see that the EU budget has been used legally and correctly, and I was, in my capacity, a accounting leader in the European Commission in 2002, shocked by the lack of control over taxpayers' money.

President of the Commission. - You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but apart from the UK, there are indeed 26 other Member States in the European Union, so you will understand that, whilst we are very sensitive about the concerns you have expressed, I have also heard other legitimate concerns.
I think that in this context, we must be careful to maintain the neutrality of EU humanitarian aid, even though sometimes this is difficult in crisis areas.
It also introduces new points on the issues put forward by Parliament in the past, for example, by calling on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of the investigations carried out by all parties and to report back to Parliament on the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States in full supervision of the investigations and concerns regarding the pressures of the Goldstone report, including those contained in them.
I also hope that this decision will help save the main species of fish.
I hope you will not regard my questions as provocation, but as a help for reflection.

I welcome the Commission's proposals for simplifying this fund.
In future, all the institutions of the EU should ensure that our budgets are aimed at helping individuals and businesses to face up to times of economic difficulty and plan for recovery.
The fastest - much more effective and better than all the top-down measures - these wounds can be rewarded by supporting civil initiatives and activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions.

It is simply not understandable for an illegal worker to cease, but ultimately punishing the person who hits him and who thus allows him to stay and to survive in this way.
I believe that this will lead to political decisions based on various study parameters which are better suited to the needs of society and the economy in general.

Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the two Commissioners and the Commission for their comments today.
