We have all been the cause, and that is our joint responsibility, so everybody would play their part in resolving the crisis.
However, this comprehensive approach has already been mentioned earlier.

Unfortunately, then, you realise that, behind many of the measures, there is a clear will to hide behind our institutions to still discover irresponsibility, which is something that does not clearly contribute legislation.
We would also like to add a few major political aspects to this because, as has already been said, we are talking here about a compartmentality that, if not in a limited form, has introduced quotas for the opposition, but is also conducted by a cross-party policy.

We can talk about 2020, but there are also major problems today: the euro area and Greece.
Information and communication technology (ICT) represents an important sector, mainly because of the weight of the European economy: it employs 7% of the workforce - the European workforce - and 6% of GDP, such as the European economy and a large proportion of the European productive and labour force.

I also hope that the Council will take Parliament's efforts in this area more seriously, although it is rather sad and worrying that the Council representative is no longer here.

In this Commission proposal, the concept of micro-enterprises is broadened and it is defined as an undertaking that does not exceed the following ceilings on the rounds of its balance sheet: EUR 500 000 balance sheet, a net turnover of EUR 1 000 and/or an average of 10 employees throughout the financial year.
At the same time, we must meet our commitment to climate change: everyone admits that we are playing a leading role in this area internationally.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I was somewhat unexpected about this situation, as I did not see today the entire time change, but I am very grateful for the opportunity to address this House on one of the important issues relating to the industry of financial services, that is, insurance and maintenance, which we have dealt with in the Solvency II report and the way in which we have finally been able to put on the table to the European Parliament in order to be very solid in the interests of the regulation.
I would therefore simply like to conclude by recalling Barack Obama's idea of either giving in to our competitors the jobs of the future or taking the opportunity of the century in a similar way to them.
Madam President, Commissioner, I have four comments to make.
Together with some other Members, I therefore also invited an expert tomorrow to investigate organ trafficking and deliberate manslaughter in China, which was the exception to organs for transplantation.

These initiatives, which will be financed from the EC funds, urge us to work on projects and programmes, in a way that combines the strengths of each institution, so as to create a workshop in which we can work together to move forward.
- (SK) We have once again a problem in Slovakia with respect for ethnic minority rights, namely the mistake of the Minister for Education, a member of an extremely nationalistic party.
In view of the necessary safeguards, such as the possibility for European citizens to submit their request for redress, similar treatment to those of the United States, and only to store their data for a certain period, in this case, the recognition of the adverse impact of globalisation.
The EIB has the opportunity to play an important role in addressing the latest events in the Mediterranean region.
I therefore support the call for a share of the price of the production and distribution chain.
However, if we put the'polluter pays' principle first - I am prepared to discuss this - then, in fact, the Member States are responsible for congestion because they do not provide an adequate infrastructure.
The first would be loans for student mobility.
However, it is important for us to be aware that, although these disasters mainly affect the southern borders of Europe, they give citizens the opportunity to stick and tie to what Europe means: and that is the added value in responding.
In spite of the fact that the proportion of qualified people in Europe, such as China and India, is still dwindling.
That is why we need a more cohesive, better, more ambitious Europe.
I am sure that we are moving in the right direction.
in writing. - (EL) The Greek Communist Party opposes and voted against the amendments to adjust the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following point: it is very surprising that, while Albania's growth indicators have been steadily rising, where growth has been more than 2% in 2010 and is expected to reach 3% in 2011, social tension is not improving, but is getting worse.
Human trafficking is still a serious problem within the European Union.
There are also other issues that I would like to emphasise, and I repeat what Mr Paparizov said.
In South Sudan, the EU must make a significant contribution to stabilisation, development and the expansion of institutional capacity.
As you said, Amendment 13 needs to be implemented in the Sri Lankan Constitution, which provides for decentralisation that the regional administration is a matter for the people living there, and the EU can provide valuable help in this.
Or, I repeat, there can, of course, be differences of opinion between the Commission and the individual Members of this House in terms of regulating water transport, some who want specific legislation and maritime transport.
I support the logic behind this proposal, namely, the need to define a consistent and comprehensive framework for improving investments in energy infrastructure within the EU, allowing the Commission to monitor the state of development of investment projects in the energy sector.
The beginning was encouraging: in 1995, we reached a global consensus that men and women are equal in all respects, including political, economic, legal and social aspects.
The Serbian authorities must do their utmost to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy work properly in the country and that there is a constant reduction in corruption in Serbia and a severe punishment for people who have returned to their positions of office.
In conclusion, the Europe that we are fighting for - a Europe of justice, social development, economic and social cohesion, cooperation between sovereign states on an equal footing - is a long way from the line proposed by the new Commission.
It is important, from the point of view of democracy and legitimacy, for us to know to our citizens what the EU is doing.
We Germans would not be worthy of our national unity if we were not to see it as a contribution to European unity, following the historic events that I have just described.
In plain language, the same person is doing the job of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner.

- Report: Elles
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has abstained within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Furthermore, the mandatory registration is an important step in increasing the transparency of relations between these organisations and the European institutions for all lobbyists who wish to enter Parliament and the Commission at all times.
However, if everything is adopted at first reading, Parliament will deprive itself of its rights.
This is a very important step which will enable the fundamental rights of EU citizens to be implemented more effectively.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the Kirilov report will take place in the coming weeks, and I am delighted with the urgent need for it.
Personally, I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation, as most vans are purchased by businesses - small and big - which are very attentive to economic and fuel efficiency.
I propose that a study be carried out on the consolidated annual accounts.
(DE) Madam President, I have a general observation and I would like to ask two or three questions, depending on how much time it gives me.
We must also remember that, if Turkey becomes a member of the European Union, we will have common borders with countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria.

Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment to this amendment, namely the deletion of two parts of the amendment by the'army in Colombia' and the words' concerning Colombia'.
I also call on the Commission to take concrete steps and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against the Roma in Europe.
Madam President, once again I think this report is good for many people.
We must draw attention once again to the excessive delay between the occurrence of the disaster, the decision to mobilise the EUSF and the actual provision of EU support to the Member States and regions affected.
We need legal evidence and that is why we have called on the French Government to provide us with these files.
Europe cannot be the sum of 27 national interests.
At the same time, Mr Reinfeldt will now report on the activities of the European Council over the last six months.
The setbacks of the austerity measures, from the fact that a number of hard-working public workers are losing their jobs, must give new businesses a advantage; an increase in entrepreneurship must be increased by reducing the start-up costs, so that we can have a profitable private sector that can take our countries out of this city.
Both political unity has been unable to develop a common vision and, as a result, progress has been undermined.
Is the free trade agreement, after all, really suited to today's world and to the current division of economic power between Europe and India, or will it still be right in 10 or twelve years' time?
The main objectives of the radio saturation policy programme are broadband access throughout the EU until 2013 and rapid Internet connections by 2020.
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only the result of the global crisis, but also, and above all, the immediate action needed when this crisis occurred in the Republic of Moldova.

Veterinary welfare requirements are now officially part of the treaty establishing the European Community and must be taken into account when identifying policies for other sectors such as the internal market.
This diversity is expressed primarily at the level of regions and their cultural heritage, a wealth which will be taken into account and brought to the fore of regional development policy.

This reserve is, in fact, a'accounting' method, which should be used in relation to unforeseen emergency spending that may arise in the current financial year.

In view of the initiatives I have just described, I believe that there is now a solid foundation on which we can improve our fishing and aquaculture sector, through innovative research within the framework programme.
We are having this debate in many ways too technocratic.
I therefore congratulate Mr Millán Mon this excellent report, which appeared at the right time to strengthen relations between the two continents.
That is why we have come up with the idea of a significant simplification of EU legislation.
Unfortunately, the important amendments from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have been rejected and, as a result, the initiatives cannot be signed by EU residents who are non-citizens, blocking the equal participation of residents of this Member State, regardless of nationality, nor by guaranteeing that signatures are the same as identification number of signatories.
I call for the creation of an independent committee of local and international legal experts, which would carry out investigations and prosecutions on the basis of acts of violence following the objectionable elections in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and the world that we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan.
It has gone too far and must stop it.
It could also effectively serve to improve regional policies by establishing guidance for public and private organisations and creating a system of training and mobility for the practical application of multi-level governance policies.
I hope that our Spanish and Italian fellow Members will take part in it, but we cannot postpone it any longer because the whole world is dealing with the innovation market.
I also believe that it is our duty to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and ensure that future strategies, from the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), are adapted to these requirements.
Mr President, the ongoing negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Vietnam must also address the issue of human rights and civil liberties.

However, this method does not make the economy and jobs out of bureaucracy, unfair competition and unprecedented price volatility.
This does not have a negative impact on the stock of capital, as there is currently a very low level of additional capital catch.

Above all, the rapporteur regrets that citizens are not aware of the rights that this would give them.
Although the creation of an area of security, justice and freedom within the European Union is of fundamental importance to us and, of course, is an example of the European democratic model that we set up, and although many of us see Europol as an instrument that can be adapted to this, we all consider it important that resources, particularly the fight against organised crime and all forms of smuggling, have to be subject to strict protection of technical resources, to the fundamental rights of our citizens.
It is therefore extremely important to adopt measures which will strengthen the guarantees guaranteeing transparency and independence of impact assessments, as this would increase the facility's role in the legislative process and ensure the quality and adequacy of the activities of EU institutions.
My second point is that the strategy should also strengthen the Union's internal cohesion and convergence.
However, I would add that the Commission has not gone in this direction, as its proposal, through the regulation adopted by Parliament, focuses on the reform of the current system of private agencies and on the very stringent consolidation of the transparency requirement in their rating work in order to avoid conflicts of interests and fairness.
It also calls on the European Commission to evaluate the costs and benefits of a completely independent European Credit Rating Foundation.

in writing. - (LT) The framework decision should not create unnecessary red tape in cases where better opportunities are available to deal with these problems.
The Bank has not seen the coming of a major crisis, nor has it been a shining regulation, which was far from perfect.
However, the European Union, this serious organisation, must be better prepared to respond to such situations and, in particular, ready to respond effectively in urgent cases.

Therefore, we should only support this classification if these measures are ineffective.
I have undertaken to inform the European institutions of civil protest.

Report: Maria do Céu Patrão Patrão Neves
I would like to go into two important issues in more detail, which have been mentioned by many in this debate today.

Thanks to the committed voting result of the Irish people, we can continue building a strong, and above all federal Europe with enthusiasm and strength.
While protecting the environment and protecting the health of the population are, I believe, a balance must be struck between the needs of consumers and of producers.
We must resolve this situation together.
We must cooperate with the major consumer countries, such as the United States, China, Russia and Japan, establish a global alert system and record illegal logging and the use of the Internet and the appropriate UN bodies, using the most up-to-date satellite technologies.
Of course, we cannot allow short-term support for this industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness.
I would like to say that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
in writing. - (PT) The effects of the current economic and social crisis are making European citizens and the EU institutions pay particular attention to the fight against unemployment and social exclusion.
This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.
Commissioner, I, too, would like to emphasise that I believe that this issue is too important for us, as Europeans, to continue to live in the lie in which it has been left.
Meanwhile, of course, we did not know - as Commissioner Barnier has already pointed out - the name of the candidates, and we did not have a single female candidate, although it has to be acknowledged that this has been explained by Commissioner Barnier.
We owe it to the large absence in the European elections and the criminal vote of the referendums.

We must support not only competitiveness but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local sales, ensuring agricultural diversity throughout Europe.
The Rapkay report on the modification of the Staff Regulations to the European External Action Service, which relates to the creation of the EEAS, is a very important document on the way to EU's foreign policy.

Firstly, it is vital that the geographical divide remains of the EU budget in terms of financial support for the Mediterranean countries and the countries of Eastern Europe, in accordance with the provisions of the financial perspective 2007-2013, and that we continue to grant support to these countries in the form of the European Investment Bank loans.

A very important approach is to highlight the human-centred and holistic elements of our policy, even if it comes to the internal market.
Mr President, I would like to express my support for what colleagues have said about disabled travellers, which Mrs Kadenbach has said about children, about fire-fighting security for hotels and, in particular, about working fire-fighting facilities in European hotels, and about the fact that the new proposals must also be a test of time.
I, too, wanted to ask a question about the gender balance in the Commission, so may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on the appointment of Cathy Ashton.
It is clear from the report that Member States have exclusive competence in matters of defence and national security, and we felt it is important to emphasise this.

From a strictly commercial point of view, I would like to ask the Commissioner for an assurance that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) should not be used to prevent the sale of medicines at more competitive prices, using safe, generic medicines which do not violate copyright, which have been produced by emerging countries such as India and Brazil, and which may distort the Western pharmaceutical industry.
After all, Members have the right to speak.
That is not acceptable.
We want to take part in this.
That is why we need to find appropriate value in financial and technological compensation.
This, too, is an area in which we can act more decisively within the framework of competition and consumer protection policy.
It is also a shame that these politicians are demanding that we accept the outcome of the second referendum when they themselves did not respect the first.

Economists use mathematical models to clarify the value of domestic immune.
We will only be able to talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law if we are fully informed about such cases.

I would like to refer to a statement by Commissioner Rehn, which I appreciate, who said is not true that Nigeria is a very poor country; Nigeria is a very rich country, but a corrupt and incompetent leadership nightmare which has plundered the resources of the country, plundering millions of citizens into poverty.
Finally, Mr Mölzer, I would like to say to you that there should be no pessimistic.
I therefore call on the Council immediately to express its position on Parliament's new proposal so that the ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010, and I call on the Commission to ensure that both producers and exporters from ACP countries respect all social and environmental requirements mutually.
Therefore, the Commission, as coordinator of the Energy Community, must seize Ukraine on the Christmas and remind it of Europe's obligations in terms of security of gas supplies.

The main objective of the regulation must be to implement a new control and culture of responsibility and not to impose a bureaucratic and costly process in which each product is monitored.
Member of the Commission. - The current EU competition policy on vertical agreements greatly supports Internet sales and I am sure that you know about this, Mr President.
On the other hand, the report contains clear recommendations on the second and third mistake, and this is heading in the right direction.
As far as transport is concerned, much more stringent measures are needed in the field of vehicle production in order for manufacturers to come up with more efficient fuel vehicles.

This also leads to two issues concerning the Europe 2020 strategy.
(EL) Madam President, as far as the processing industry is concerned, I should like to remind the House that Pakistan represents 9% of the world's fourth-largest cotton producers, 9% of world cotton production, and in the next place the European Union is less than 5.5%.

We need more and better European economic governance, so that national measures also support this line, including a tax on financial transactions, which I would like to consider carefully and in a European context.
In my opinion, the mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important, as it is linked not only to healthcare but also to follow-up care, but also to a period during which the details can be drawn up.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports, which discuss important issues in how the European Union's trade policy can contribute to achieving some of the fundamental objectives of public policy, such as respect for human rights, the creation of economic prosperity and social justice, the creation of sustainable growth, and the consideration of the environment and climate aspects in particular.

In this context, Greece needs to adopt a comprehensive structural reform programme aimed at increasing the efficiency of public administration, accelerating pension and health reform, operating the labour market and improving the efficiency of the labour market and labour market negotiation system, promoting the functioning of the product market and the business environment, and maintaining the stability of the banking and financial sector.
In our opinion, the following must be taken into account when concluding agreements between sovereign countries: respect for the sovereignty of countries and their peoples, mutual interests, reciprocity and cooperation, taking into account the specific features of each country; evaluation of what it contributes to the agreement from an economic, social and cultural point of view.
I believe that it will also proceed without introducing legal measures that go beyond the transition to a sustainable, environmentally friendly economy.
Everyone seems to have forgotten the role played by the US and, of course, NATO in ensuring peace in Europe.
I believe that this should be considered as an opportunity to deal with what Europe so badly needs: economic growth, jobs, the dynamic small enterprise sector, more innovation, more effective public procurement - things on which our citizens will judge.
In my opinion, it is not our job to predict possible developments in these countries in advance.
The second is the concession project.
Mr President, during the EU elections in 2004, Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace, so many voters angry before restaurants and toys.
At a time of disappointment over the activities of states, the growing EU budget is an expression of trust in the joint project and a strengthening of activity at supranational level.

This report contains guidelines for analysing the content of air transport agreements and for applicable procedures.
The language law creates imbalance.
Perhaps on 1 December, when the Treaty of Lisbon finally enters into force, the British domestic political debate could emerge from this Chamber.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a total of five extra questions have been submitted about economic governance and Europe 2020.
That is why, in my opinion, we must actively involve the national authorities, the European Commission and MEPs in the promotion of SOLVIT.
This system is based on real policies and guidelines, and now, Mr Michel, is also at the forefront, as well as on liberal rhetoric, and these have led to the current situation that is marked by: support for the agri-industrial model in line with the interests of the big industrialists in the food sector and, consequently, the deterioration of agriculture standards worldwide; phenomena that have lasted as many as possible in the agricultural sector as 70% of small farms as possible.

That is why they fought together, whether in a blue light or in an orange way.
I believe that this procedure and the strengthening of EU food security will give greater clarity to Member States and third countries which export meat preparations to the EU.
In view of this, compliance with the Mercosur Convention appears to be bold, especially as the Swedish Food and Technological Institute has shown that the coal footprint of Brazilian beef could be between 35 and 35 times higher than that of Irish beef.
For this reason, the following text must be inserted by the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, which is Article 1 (b) of the amending regulation:'The same reference rate must be applied in the annual revision of the value of the charges covered by Article 4a, 4b and 63 (if not the euro'.
The Irish Government has today called for European solidarity, and rightly so, it has received solidarity.
Look at Ireland, a country that has been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis: its membership of the monetary union has been protected from an even greater crisis.
Mr Klaus is holding up from German demands for seudo-building and I think, given the statements made by the German politicians on this issue, that his fear is entirely justified.

Similarly, the Member States will also decide whether or not to sign up to the Council of Europe's two main documents, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Minorities and Regional Languages.
For this reason, it is a structured dialogue that gives us the opportunity to exchange views on issues of interest to all of us.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, so that people in work can be protected and given a certain amount of support, so that they do not lose their jobs and then can be retrained and trained in one or two years' time, so that they can find new jobs or keep their current jobs.
Madam President, the intention of our questions is to highlight the benefits that our citizens can expect from this package of measures and what we can offer them in this package.

In addition, we have carried out a review of the unused funds for 2009, with a total of EUR 1.9 billion available for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in the category II category.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for this clear message.
We can see something there, too, and we can also see the ambition to apply a holistic approach, which was not as we thought, but which is at least moving in the right direction.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, which, at times, was a little tougher than the pleasing, as well as the Council, where we tried to find sensible solutions at late midnight and during several trialogues, because they also adopted the reasonable compromise we reached an hour ago.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission, together with the organisation Eurocontrol after the meeting of the Committee on Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010, established a European Aviation Crisis Coordination.

Political parties can be banned; there is corruption in the legal system; there is a violation of human rights; freedom of expression and freedom of association do not exist in the way that Britain or other European states do.
It is also quite clear that we need a different energy mix composed of energy sources from energy sources based on the widest possible basis, because this will stabilise the energy situation and, by extension, will ensure that individual nations and Europe are also able to diversify.
However, I have considerable doubts when Parliament refers to international law in its condemnation of certain reckless practices, while the legal basis for this is far from clear.
By voting in favour of the motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I express my full support for the Tunisian people and for the historic uprisings they have begun.

We are facing another major problem with a new feeling of mutual confidence.
This year, we have allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million for the EEAS, but the actual costs will only be found after the first year of operation when all reports containing expenditure on EEAS activities come before the European Parliament.
My question relates to Pakistan, whose chronic instability, as we all know, is one of the factors in the entire region and Afghanistan's crisis.

Last week, I accused the Belgian Presidency with a shadow rapporteur during the committee meeting.

In particular, it will be very important for funds to be launched rapidly.
One thing is to create such a mechanism, but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens in order to allow them to make full use of the opportunities it offers.
Apart from increasing the competitiveness of Canadian and European markets, the agreement also makes them safer, as regulators and enforcement authorities are cooperating more and more intensively in all areas of certification, control and enforcement, in order to guarantee the greatest safety for passengers and cargo flights.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a meaningful debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
In addition, it is a private aspect that not only increases the image that Europe represents for the world, but also promotes European citizenship.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the proposal we are discussing today is to amend the legislation approved in 2004, which has improved and harmonised the safety rules for the protection of EU citizens, passports and travel documents against fraudulent use, while simultaneously introducing elements of biometric identification.
Secondly, a temporary institutional framework must be established for the purpose of the decision enforcement mechanism.
To make a positive point, we have recently concluded some very good agreements, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again of the social clause in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will realise that the approach to current constructive cooperation with the European Union is much more effective than repeated attempts to write history.
It seems strange that, to this day, the European Commission has not found any good arguments or time to influence the Latvian Government in order to put an end to linguistic discrimination.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to switch all forms of aid to the Pakistani Government to the urgent elimination of the disastrous discrimination against religious minorities in the country.
This will be an effective tool for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
That is also acceptable and legitimate, and we fought for ourselves.

The main objective of encouraging trade is to increase the competitiveness of 48 states at home and at international level.
Even if we accept the rationale of internalising external costs as a starting point, it is ultimately untenable that, in order to reduce traffic congestion, heavy goods vehicles are penalised only, and not the general cars, just as the good old'polluter pays' principle is clearly discriminated against.
I was very encouraged by understanding and support in plenary.
Furthermore, if we look at the starting point, we have some concerns.
The primary objective of the governments of the European Union and of the Member States, whether on the right or in the centre-left, is to ensure the continuous profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the workers throughout the European Union.

Therefore, the Commission must speak out strongly.
We cannot interfere in an issue where the US Government has exclusive competence.

There are large dealers whose presence on the market of certain Member States is very strong, but there are many small dealers that are more pleased with our current proposal than the regulation in force since 2002, because they see that certain aspects that have not been in the intention of the legislator in 2002 have not served their interests but rather made it difficult for them to compete with the major dealers.
It must build a'EU regional policy partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', which was launched by the Committee on Development when adopting the report of April 2007.

All forms of medical assistance fall within the scope of the treaty that created the European Union, irrespective of their distinctive characteristics.
I would like to draw the House's attention to something that is very important: in the recent study by the European Kariological Society, it was reiterated that this method was greatly restricted by very few women taking part in clinical studies.
It is not the idea that investment agreements should be used to achieve social objectives, but at the same time that investment agreements should not prevent us from achieving our social and environmental objectives.
Greater emphasis must be placed on the recovery of organic waste, especially in this largely agricultural region, the data must be monitored and the establishment of a system for exchanging best practices.
There is a totally incomprehensible piece of legislation which states that Orthodox priests, bishops and Patriarcos must be Turkish citizens.

(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured that the European Union will accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

We want an appropriate strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment, which will finally improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region after implementation.
This is a real achievement, given that, apart from deepening the legal basis, the directive recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and provides a whole range of new opportunities for access to better treatment.
Year after year, the Court of Auditors is unable to provide acceptable evidence of the legitimate and regular use of the EU budget and, as a contractor to the European Commission in 2002, I was extremely concerned that taxpayers' money was not properly monitored.
For me, this is a huge challenge and also a great honour.
If we are honest, then we have to acknowledge our historic responsibility for climate change and that our per capita emissions are still multiplied, for example, to similar Chinese or Indian data.
I am sure that we will then have a constructive dialogue.
We regret that, like Europol, attempts to preserve fundamental freedoms have been undergone in the face of haste.
I agree with the Commission's proposal to introduce a simpler use method for the European Social Fund's reserves, to ensure that it can respond more quickly and effectively to the economic and social difficulties facing Europe.
Frankly, I would have preferred to have voted against the Commission in view of the unseen Commissioners, but I trust the nominated candidates, such as the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
President of the Commission. - Mr Kirkhope, but there are actually 26 other Member States outside the European Union, so you will understand that although we are very sensitive to the concerns that you mentioned, I have other legitimate concerns.
I believe that we should be careful to maintain the neutrality of EU humanitarian aid even if this is sometimes difficult in crisis areas.
It also gives new points, as Parliament has already said, to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, for example, to evaluate the investigation carried out by all parties and to report to Parliament, reminding us that the EU and the Member States are demanding full control of the investigations and to express concern over the non-governmental measures that have been taken, including those under pressure from the Goldstone report and beyond it.
I also hope that the resolution will help to prevent the disappearance of fish species.
I hope that you will not provoke my questions, as I would just like to help you consider it.

This result strengthens the Union's negotiating position in international trade negotiations, especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations on the World Trade Organisation.

I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) that is independent of European structural policy.
The number of new infections is still far beyond the scope of treatment and in 2009, two thirds of those who need treatment were not yet given, which means that 10 million people did not have the necessary effective treatment.
Indeed, if we respect human dignity, we see minorities in absolutely no negative light.
I welcome the Commission's proposals on simplifying this fund.
All EU institutions must ensure in the future that the cost framework is created so that individuals and businesses can overcome difficult economic times and also plan for recovery.
The quickest way to pull up, which is much more effective and practical than any top-down measure, is to support citizens' initiatives, cultural organisations and regional institutions.

Sanctions must be applied by the Commission, not by the finance ministers.
The economic recovery of Sri Lanka depends on foreign direct investment and on EU economic support.

There are countries that do not make full use of the ESF allocated to them and 30% or 40% remain.

The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I strongly support the proposal to have an effective information campaign that would draw attention to the points of single contact.
in writing. - (DE) It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and to make it compulsory to implement economic policy objectives.

One thing, Commissioner, is a little dubious for me, and that is that of the CARS 21 and the sector's significant influence on the process that we are embarking on here.
We do not agree with that.
In 2010, the amount of EU assistance earmarked for supporting democracy and good governance in Moldova for the period 2007-2013 amounts to more than EUR 50 million.

Finally, High Representative, you will visit the Middle East.
What is even more serious is that the US Congress was annoying by adopting the American Service-Members Act after the establishment of the International Criminal Court in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly outline that the report contains amendments which were adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following the resolution adopted during the plenary on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission's proposal to authorise the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption, including in the case of prior anti-microtreatment.

The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme for freedom, security and justice (2010-2014).
Do our motto not waste one cent!
The Union and, in particular, the countries around the sea, have always been at the forefront of humanitarian aid for the Sahrawi people, because the principle of solidarity with the people living in such problematic conditions is essential.
Often, employees themselves are isolated, and accession to trade unions is very difficult in this situation.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today.
However, as it currently stands, Mrs Guillaume's report, even if some amendments have helped to improve, in fact encourages people to misuse this procedure and to prevent the relevant services, thus depriving those who really need their case to be examined quickly.

We also need to take a special look at the situation of Roma women, who suffer particularly from the problems of poverty, the difficulties of accessing housing, discrimination and violence; and we also need to look at the problem of Roma young people, because in this case, the lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult to find a job in the current economic crisis.
I was pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which aims to extend its powers in the housing sector in order to help marginalised communities in Member States.
It is a reminder to all politicians that, in order to achieve effective freedom of the press, public bodies must play a role: they must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and promote its development.
Mr President, I believe that the European Union has become too large, that it brings together too many cultures, and I simply do not trust this system, which I think will be even worse.
It is a little early to announce the results of the analysis and, as the Member will be aware, all steps in the process require unanimous decision by the Council.
It is important to note that the prospect of EU integration for the Balkan countries is the strongest incentive for implementing the necessary reforms and contributing to regional stability.
At this time when advertising has an even greater role to play, it is essential to lay down criteria allowing consumers and patients to be fully informed and secure in terms of the impact of medicines.
Neil Armitt's words would be a small step for European funds, but a huge leap for the European economy.

Anyone who makes the decisions in this area must have equal access to suitable information on the country of origin of the asylum seeker and the organs authorised to hear appeals, as do asylum seekers.
So, after so many years, I can assess how important it was to build the only multi-ethnic parliament in the world, elected by universal suffrage.
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion a year on defence, and that EUR 200 billion must be spent better than we have done in the past.
Together, we have achieved a change.

I can therefore propose, for example, that we present Mr Almunia, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who was quite critical of some countries during his term of office and then raised the Greek problem.
In this regard, reforms in Turkey are very much needed.
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, such as Portugal and Spain, and we must therefore also now grant this assistance to Lithuania.

This fund also plays a significant role in the education of workers, professional training for life, improving job opportunities and involving workers in the labour market.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes

This has happened now and I supported the proposal in the vote.
Only one answer can be given to this: growth.
